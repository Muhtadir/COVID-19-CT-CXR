      <text>Multiple, patchy, sub-segmental or segmental ground-glass density shadows in both lungs. They were classified as “paving stone-like” changes by fine-grid or small honeycomb-like thickening of interlobular septa. The thinner the CT scan layers, the clearer the ground-glass opacity and thickening of interlobular septa were displayed. A slightly high-density and ground-glass change with fuzzy edge in the fine-grid or small honeycomb-like thickening of interlobular septa were presented by the high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), (Fig. 1: 45 cases, 54.2% in a total of 83 cases). The resolution of X-ray was worse lower than that of CT in the resolution, which was basically manifested as ground-glass opacities with fuzzy edge (Fig. 2: 9 cases, 10.8% in a total of 83 cases).</text>

      <text>Consolidation stage. This stage refers to the period around 7–14 days after clinical manifestations appeared. The main pathological features in this stage are the fibrous exudation of the alveolar cavity and the disappearance of capillary congestion in the alveolar wall. CT imaging showed the multiple patchy consolidations in slighter density and smaller range than that of the previous stage. (Fig. 9: 26 cases, 31.2% in a total of 83 cases).</text>

      <text>CT imaging of dissipation stage. A 79 years old female with intermittent fever. Laboratory test after 3 days of comprehensive treatment: decreased red blood cells (3.73 × 1012/L), hemoglobin (107 g/L), decreased hematocrit (31.8%), decreased lymphocytes percentage (13.9%), decreased lymphocytes (0.62 × 109/ L), decreased eosinophil count percentage (0%), decreased eosinophil count (0 × 109/L), increased alanine aminotransferase (46 U/L), deceased total protein (56.8 g/L), decreased albumin (33.5 g/L), normal C-reaction protein and procalcitonin. Imaging examination: a patchy ground-glass opacity and grid-like thickening of interlobular septa in the tongue-like segment of left upper lobe, and patchy consolidation in the posterior segment of right middle and lower lobe. b 9 days after admission to hospotial, CT scan showed absorption of lesions in the middle lobe, narrowing of lesions in the lower lobe of the right lung, and absorption of lesions in the tongue-like segment of left upper lobe which exhibited a cord-like change</text>

      <text>Dissipation stage. This stage refers to the period roughly between 2 and 3 weeks after the onset of clinical manifestations. The range of lesions was further reduced. CT imaging showed patchy consolidation or strip-like opacity. As time goes on, it showed grid-like thickening of interlobular septum, thickening and strip-like twist of bronchial wall and a few scattered patchy consolidations (Fig. 10: 17 cases, 20.5% in a total of 83 cases).</text>

      <text>One day before entry (January 18, 2020), she developed fever, chill, and myalgia, and she visited a local clinic in Wuhan. Chest radiography showed no infiltrates, and she was diagnosed as a common cold. She is obese (body mass index, 33.4 kg/m2) but otherwise healthy. On admission (January 19, 2020), the physical examination revealed a body temperature of 38.4°C, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, a pulse of 118 per minute, and a blood pressure of 139/92 mmHg. There were no pharyngeal injections, skin rash, and adenopathy. The initial chest radiography showed no infiltrations (Fig. 1A), but high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) on January 21, 2020 (day 4 of illness) showed multiple, ground-glass opacities located in both subpleural spaces (Fig. 1B-E). The laboratory tests showed mild changes, including leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and liver enzyme elevation (Table 1). During admission, she developed nasal congestion, cough, sputum, pleuritic chest discomfort, and watery diarrhea.</text>

      <text>There were some reports about lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) for the treatment of COVID-19. Lopinavir/ritonavir was started from the hospital day 8 (day 10 of illness); 2 tablets (lopinavir 200 mg/ritonavir 50 mg) were given per oral bid. Interestingly, from the next day of lopinavir/ritonavir administration, β-coronavirus viral load started to decrease and no detectable or little coronavirus titers have been observed since then (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1).</text>

      <text>Chest CT examination is very important in the initial diagnosis of the new type of pneumonia, and CT changes are variable. By collecting chest CT of patients with 2019-nCov related pneumonia in our hospital, we summarized the common imaging changes of the patients. CT is often found to be positive when patients with 2019-nCoV develop persistent fever, cough, and unexplained weakness. Early CT lung manifestations are diverse: they may be lung ground glass shadow (Fig. 1a–c), pulmonary consolidation and nodules (Fig. 1d), and local consolidation in the center with ground glass density around (Fig. 1e). Depending on the course of the disease, pneumonia may involve one or more lobes simultaneously (Fig. 1a, c, g). When one or two lobes are involved, the effect on lung function is not serious, and the symptoms of shortness of breath and dyspnea are not severe. As the disease progresses, the consolidation area of the lung begins to absorb, reducing its density and gradually becoming a ground glass opacity, like “melted sugar” (Fig. 1f). At this point, if the patient receives effective treatment or if immunity successfully fights against the virus, the inflammation will be further absorbed and the extent will be minimized. The disease will improve, perhaps leaving the lung fiber cord focus (Fig. 1g). This very much resembles a bout of flu. If the treatment is not received promptly or if immunity fails to fight off the virus, in time, it becomes life-threatening. Lung can progress to a "white lung" appearance (Fig. 1h), however, this is only seen in a very small number of patients with diffuse alveolar damage involving multiple lobes. At this stage, the ventilation function will be seriously impaired, requiring continuous oxygen inhalation, and even extracorporeal membrane pulmonary oxygenation (ECMO).</text>

      <text>Case 1 was a male doctor in his 40s with an exposure history to COVID-19 patients. He experienced fever (up to 39.3 °C), chill and fatigue on 15 January (Figure 1). Chest CT showed lung infection in the lower left lobe on 18 January, and he was admitted to hospital on the same day. During the hospitalisation from 18 January to 10 February, his condition first deteriorated and then reached remission on 28 January. Throat swab tests for SARS-CoV-2 were positive on 28 January and 2 February, and turned negative on 7 and 9 February. Stool tests of SARS-CoV-2, first conducted on 7 February, were also negative on 7 and 9 February. The exact Ct values were unavailable.</text>

      <text>We recently reported in Intensive Care Medicine the imaging changes of acute stage from a case of 75-year-old male patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia combined acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and multiple organ disfunction syndrome (MODS) who had a history of 10-year hypertension and 1-year diabetes. He presently received advanced life support treatment including respiratory support (invasive mechanical ventilation) and circulatory support (vasoconstrictor assistance), as well as intermittent renal replacement therapy (IRRT) in intensive care unit (ICU) of our hospital—a tertiary teaching hospital of medical university. Because his MODS still existed on the day 20 after symptom onset, we had to re-examine the chest computed tomographic (CT). The results showed that early changes of reticular pulmonary fibrosis appeared in Panels D, E, and F (marked by green arrows), compensatory emphysema occurred in Panels D and E (marked by blue arrows), and pulmonary cavity formation appeared in Panel F (marked by blue arrows), compared with acute stage of the day 5 after symptom onset, inflammatory lesions and ground glass shadow of Panels A and B (marked by red arrows), as well as septal line of Panel C (marked by yellow arrows). Presently, this patient is still under the condition of advanced life support therapy (Fig. 1).</text>

      <text>A 75-year-old male who was confirmed as suffering of severe COVID pneumonia was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our hospital—a tertiary teaching hospital of a medical university. He had a history of 10-year hypertension and one-year diabetes. A physical examination unveiled that his body temperature was 35.5 ℃, his pulse was 54 beats per minute, his blood pressure was 136/79 mm Hg (noradrenaline 0.2 µg/kg/min), his oxygen saturation was 91% (noninvasive ventilation), and oxygenation index (OI: PO2/FiO2) 100 mmHg. He was diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia combined with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). We focused on the typical imaging feature of chest CT in the patient (Fig. 1). The white “Septal Line” marked by the red arrow in Fig. 1 (Panel a–d) suggests that cellulosic exudation occurred in the surface of lung lobes. In dynamic imaging, these white lines are clearly visible, which provides evidence for us to judge severe COVID-19 pneumonia. In the three-dimensional imaging system, three-dimensional reconstruction of bilateral lung lesions provided a key clue for early identification of the disease. Presently, his condition is relatively stable.</text>

      <text>All included patients underwent baseline chest non-contrast enhanced CT in a designated hospital (Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital). An Optima CT680 scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) was used and set at 210 mA and 120 kV, with the minimum slice thickness of 1 mm. All images were analyzed by two senior chest radiologists with 15–20 years of experience, in a consistent manner. Image analysis, focused on the lesion features of each patient, included (a) distribution characteristics, (b) number of lobes involved, (c) lobe of lesion distribution, (d) patterns of the lesion (e.g., ground glass opacification, consolidation, cavitation, crazy paving pattern), (e) other signs in the lesion (e.g., interlobular septal thickening, air bronchogram sign), and (f) other findings (e.g., adjacent pleura thickening, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, thoracic lymphadenopathy, pulmonary emphysema). Thoracic lymphadenopathy was defined as lymph node size of ≥ 10 mm in short-axis; ground glass opacification was defined as hazy opacity that did not obscure underlying bronchial and vascular margins (Figs. 1 and 2); consolidation was defined as opacification with obscuration of bronchial structures and pulmonary vessels; crazy paving pattern was defined as ground glass opacification with associated interlobular septal thickening  (Fig. 3). The alterations caused by underlying lung diseases (such as tuberculosis, lung cancer) were not included in this study.</text>

      <text>The CT features, including the location, extent and distribution of involvement of each abnormality were shown in Table 2. The median days of CT scans were 8 (IQR 5–11) before symptom onset in all patients. The predominant CT characteristics consisted of ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and central distribution (74%), and lower zone involved (96%). Lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion were relatively seldom seen (0% and 4%). The median CT score of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7–13) vs 12 (IQR 11–43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40% vs 6%, P = 0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025) (Fig 2).</text>

      <text>On admission, she was not dyspneic nor cyanotic with a body temperature of 37.7°C. Initial laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell count 4,080/μL (37.3% lymphocytes), hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL, platelet count 251,000/μL, and C-reactive protein &lt; 0.40 mg/dL. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Data 1) was serially tested for the samples from nasopharynx, throat, saliva, serum, stool, and urine. Viral tests were positive in the samples from nasopharynx, throat, and stool (Fig. 2A). Serum, saliva, and urine tested negative on hospital days 3 and 8. Because the RT-PCR was developed for the qualitative assay, the cycle threshold values of RT-PCR could not be converted to viral load kinetics in this report. It is noteworthy, however, that stool samples were positive until the 17th day since symptom onset.</text>

      <text>More often, AI-driven tools are limited to one data type. Decisions that are solely based on one data type (regardless of the data size) may be skewed away from the severity of coronavirus influence. In such a case, use of mutitudinal and multimodal data can help support decision-making process with higher confidence. Since coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry, the most popularly used data for AI-driven tools mostly employ RNA sequences. Besides, Electronic Health Record (EHRs), Computerized Tomography (CT) scans, Chest X-rays (CRRs, see Fig. 4), and other data are considered and tested. Alibaba launched a new AI-based system to detect coronavirus infection via CT scans with an accuracy of up to 96%. As mentioned before, AD in image consists in finding portion of the images (a set of pixels) with anomalous and unusual patterns. With small changes in image pixels, spatio-temporal signatures can be deviated from standard threshold(s). Since AD is not just limited to image data; it can be applied for all types of data that are ranging from a vector (1D array/signal/pattern), 2D matrix (image, for instance) to multi-dimensional data. In the recently reported work, Chest CT (see Fig. 5, as an example) – which is used to diagnose COVID-19 – can be complemented to the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. Therefore, instead of using different machine learning models for one data type (and even small size data) and looking for ensemble techniques to combine results, for AI researchers, it is wise to use mutitudinal and multimodal data to check whether different data types can help yield consistent decisions about the coronavirus outbreak over time.</text>

      <text>The imaging manifestations of the new coronavirus pneumonia are similar to common viral pneumonia, but also have its own imaging characteristics. In our study, patients may have a single lobe or multiple lobes involvement; 30.2% of patients had only one lobe involved, and 44.4% had all lobes involvement. This study shows that the most common manifestations of new coronavirus pneumonia are patchy/punctate ground glass opacities (85.7%), patchy consolidation (19.0%), and mainly distributed in a sub-pleural area (Fig. 1c–f); chest CT of the patients for re-examination after 3–14 days were also observed. It was found that, as the disease progressed, the range of ground glass density patches and consolidation increased (Fig. 2a1, a2), which were mainly distributed in the middle and outer zones of the lung. When patients' condition would improve, a little fibrous stripe may appear. Conversely, when patients' condition worsened, the lungs showed diffuse lesions, and the density of both lungs increased widely, showing a "white lung" appearance, which seriously affects the patient's lung function. It is worth noting that only a single GGO can be seen in some patients at an early stage, and the range significantly increases in the short-term re-examination (Fig. 2a1, a2). In some patients, even if only few fibrous stripes are seen at an early stage, consolidation can develop in the short-term reexamination (Fig. 2b1, b2). In some patients with irregular solid nodules of varying sizes at the early stage, re-examination CT showed that the nodules increased, enlarged, and merged; the density of some solid nodules is reduced, showing a ground glass density, like “melting sugar” (Fig. 2c1–d2).</text>

This study shows that the most common manifestations of new coronavirus pneumonia are patchy/punctate ground glass opacities (85.7%), patchy consolidation (19.0%), and mainly distributed in a sub-pleural area (Fig. 1c–f); chest CT of the patients for re-examination after 3–14 days were also observed. It was found that, as the disease progressed, the range of ground glass density patches and consolidation increased (Fig. 2a1, a2), which were mainly distributed in the middle and outer zones of the lung. When patients' condition would improve, a little fibrous stripe may appear. Conversely, when patients' condition worsened, the lungs showed diffuse lesions, and the density of both lungs increased widely, showing a "white lung" appearance, which seriously affects the patient's lung function. It is worth noting that only a single GGO can be seen in some patients at an early stage, and the range significantly increases in the short-term re-examination (Fig. 2a1, a2). In some patients, even if only few fibrous stripes are seen at an early stage, consolidation can develop in the short-term reexamination (Fig. 2b1, b2). In some patients with irregular solid nodules of varying sizes at the early stage, re-examination CT showed that the nodules increased, enlarged, and merged; the density of some solid nodules is reduced, showing a ground glass density, like “melting sugar” (Fig. 2c1–d2).</text>

      <text>GGO were defined as hazy areas with slightly increased density in lungs without obscuration of bronchial and vascular margins, which may be caused by partial displacement of air due to partial filling of airspaces or interstitial thickening. In patients with COVID-19, unilaterally or bilaterally GGO with a peripheral lung and subpleural distribution are commonly encountered (Fig. 1a). In the very first radiologic investigation of 21 patients by Chung et al, GGO was found in 57% patients and was believed to be the earliest radiographically visible CT manifestation in some patients. These results are consistent with those of other subsequent studies, presenting GGO as the most common imaging finding with occurrence rate of up to 98%. Recently, the first post-mortem biopsy in a COVID-19 patient was reported, showing pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation in both lungs, which we speculate may be the underlying pathological driver of GGO sign. Moreover, GGO are often accompanied by other features or patterns, including reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening and consolidation. GGO together with small areas of consolidation may suggest an organizing pneumonia pattern of lung injury.</text>

      <text>Consolidation refers to alveolar air being replaced by pathological fluids, cells, or tissues, manifested by an increase in pulmonary parenchymal density that obscures the margins of underlying vessels and airway walls. Multifocal, patchy, or segmental consolidation, distributed in subpleural areas or along bronchovascular bundles, is usually presented in COVID-19 patients (Fig. 1b) with occurrence rate of 2~64%. In COVID-19 patients, consolidation may relate to cellular fibromyxoid exudates in alveoli. In addition, consolidation was considered as an indication of disease progression. A recent study showed lung involvement gradually increased to consolidation up to 2 weeks after disease onset, which concurs with another conclusion that GGO could progress to or co-existed with consolidations within 1–3 weeks. Likewise, Song et al found more consolidative lesions in patients with longer time interval between symptom onset and CT scan or older than 50 years old, suggesting that this manifestation could serve as an alert in the management of patients.</text>

      <text>Reticular pattern was defined as thickened pulmonary interstitial structures such as interlobular septa and intralobular lines, manifested as a collection of innumerable small linear opacities on CT images (Fig. 2a). The formation of this pattern might associate with interstitial lymphocyte infiltration causing interlobular septal thickening. Several studies have listed reticular pattern with interlobular septal thickening as the common chest CT manifestation of COVID-19, only second to GGO and consolidation. As the disease course gets longer, the prevalence of reticular pattern could increase in COVID-19 patients.</text>

      <text>Crazy paving pattern demonstrates as thickened interlobular septa and intralobular lines with superimposition on a GGO background, resembling irregular paving stones (Fig. 2b), which was not frequently observed as GGO and consolidation. Based on the previous pathological knowledge of SARS, this sign may result from the alveolar edema and interstitial inflammatory of acute lung injury. Recent investigations reported 5~36% COVID-19 patients with crazy paving pattern in their studies. Additionally, in combination with diffuse GGO and consolidation, crazy paving pattern can be the signal of COVID-19 entering progressive or peak stage.</text>

      <text>Air bronchogram was defined as a pattern of air-filled (low-attenuation) bronchi on a background of opaque (high-attenuation) airless lung and was reported to be another CT manifestation of COVID-19 (Fig. 3a). However, according to a recent general observation report of the COVID-19 autopsy, gelatinous mucus attachment was present in the lung bronchus; therefore, we infer the low-attenuation bronchi in CT imaging may be filled with gelatinous mucus instead of air. Moreover, this sign was often accompanied by slightly bronchiolar dilatation, and thus we think it may be more appropriate to term it as bronchiolectasis. As for the dry cough in COVID-19 patients, we surmise it may be explained by the high viscosity of mucus and the damage of dilated bronchioles, resulting in insufficient sputum motility.</text>

      <text>Airway changes include bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening (Fig. 3b). Bronchiectasis was reported in some COVID-19 cases, while bronchial wall thickening has been reported in around 10% to 20% COVID-19 patients. Pathogenesis can be the inflammatory damage of the bronchial wall and the bronchial obstruction, resulting in the destruction of bronchial wall structure, proliferation of fibrous tissue, fibrosis, and tractive bronchiectasis. Li et al investigated 83 COVID-19 patients and found the incidence of bronchial wall thickening in severe/critical patients was significantly higher than that in ordinary patients.</text>

      <text>Pleural changes including pleural thickening (Fig. 4a) and pleural effusion were reported in COVID-19, among which, the former sign is more prevalent. According to a recent study comprising 81 patients with COVID-19, 32% of them demonstrated pleural thickening while 5% showed pleural effusion. Based on the experience of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-­CoV) infection and recent findings, the presence of pleural effusion may suggest a poor prognosis in COVID-19. Moreover, the recent autopsy report also revealed a photo of pleural thickening with extensive adhesion in a COVID-19 patient, suggesting consistency between CT imaging presentations and autopsy findings.</text>

      <text>CT manifestations of fibrosis or fibrous stripes were also observed in COVID-19 (Fig. 4c). Pan et al reported 17% COVID-19 patients with fibrous stripes in their study. Fibrous lesions may form during the healing of pulmonary chronic inflammation or proliferative diseases, with gradual replacement of cellular components by scar tissues. Currently, the relation between fibrosis and patients’ prognosis is debatable. Some researchers suggested the presence of fibrosis indicates good prognosis of a COVID-19 patient with stabilizing disease status. However, others argued that fibrosis might indicate a poor outcome of COVID-19, reporting it may subsequently progress to peak stage or result in pulmonary interstitial fibrosis disease.</text>

One previous study reported this particular CT manifestation on a RT-PCR-negative COVID-19 patient who was admitted to a hospital 6 days after symptom onset. Although rarely reported, we found this manifestation in most of our cases, which might be attributed to the damage and swelling of the capillary wall caused by pro-inflammatory factors.</text>

      <text>Air bubble sign refers to a small air-containing space in the lung (Fig. 5a), which might be the pathological dilation of a physiological space or a cross section of the bronchiolectasis, or associated with the process of consolidation resorption. Shi et al termed this sign as round cystic change in their study, while Kong et al reported it as cavity sign. However, given the displayed pictures in their studies and the definition of cyst and cavity, we believe it may be more appropriate to term this small bubble-like air-containing space as air bubble sign.</text>

History inquiry showed that he had traveled with his family to Xiaogan City, China (the subcenter of COVID-19 outbreak neighboring Wuhan City in Hubei Province) 10 days ago. Both the physical and laboratory examinations of the boy were unremarkable. White blood cell count was normal of 6.6 × 109/L, with 34.1% neutrophils and 52% lymphocytes. C-reactive protein was also normal (3.49 mg/L; normal range, 0–10 mg/L). Unenhanced chest CT results were normal (Fig. 2a). The oropharyngeal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.</text>

The physical examination revealed a body temperature of 37.2°C, blood pressure of 134/87 mm Hg, pulse of 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Lung auscultation revealed rhonchi, and chest radiography was performed, which was reported as showing no abnormalities (Figure 1). A rapid nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for influenza A and B was negative. A nasopharyngeal swab specimen was obtained and sent for detection of viral respiratory pathogens by NAAT; this was reported back within 48 hours as negative for all pathogens tested, including influenza A and B, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, and four common coronavirus strains known to cause illness in humans (HKU1, NL63, 229E, and OC43).</text>

However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.</text>

      <text>On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.</text>

      <text>Three adult patients presented with severe pneumonia and were admitted to a hospital in Wuhan on December 27, 2019. Patient 1 was a 49-year-old woman, Patient 2 was a 61-year-old man, and Patient 3 was a 32-year-old man. Clinical profiles were available for Patients 1 and 2. Patient 1 reported having no underlying chronic medical conditions but reported fever (temperature, 37°C to 38°C) and cough with chest discomfort on December 23, 2019. Four days after the onset of illness, her cough and chest discomfort worsened, but the fever was reduced; a diagnosis of pneumonia was based on computed tomographic (CT) scan. Her occupation was retailer in the seafood wholesale market. Patient 2 initially reported fever and cough on December 20, 2019; respiratory distress developed 7 days after the onset of illness and worsened over the next 2 days (see chest radiographs, Figure 1), at which time mechanical ventilation was started. He had been a frequent visitor to the seafood wholesale market. Patients 1 and 3 recovered and were discharged from the hospital on January 16, 2020. Patient 2 died on January 9, 2020. No biopsy specimens were obtained.</text>

      <text>To investigate the possible aetiological agents associated with this disease, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and performed deep meta-transcriptomic sequencing. The clinical specimen was handled in a biosafety level 3 laboratory at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. Total RNA was extracted from 200 μl of BALF and a meta-transcriptomic library was constructed for pair-end (150-bp reads) sequencing using an Illumina MiniSeq as previously described. In total, we generated 56,565,928 sequence reads that were de novo-assembled and screened for potential aetiological agents. Of the 384,096 contigs assembled by Megahit, the longest (30,474 nucleotides (nt)) had a high abundance and was closely related to a bat SARS-like coronavirus (CoV) isolate—bat SL-CoVZC45 (GenBank accession number MG772933)—that had previously been sampled in China, with a nucleotide identity of 89.1% (Supplementary Tables 1, 2). The genome sequence of this virus, as well as its termini, were determined and confirmed by reverse-transcription PCR (RT–PCR) and 5′/3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), respectively. This virus strain was designated as WH-Human 1 coronavirus (WHCV) (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’) and its whole genome sequence (29,903 nt) has been assigned GenBank accession number MN908947. Remapping the RNA-sequencing data to the complete genome of WHCV resulted in an assembly of 123,613 reads, providing 99.99% genome coverage at a mean depth of 6.04× (range, 0.01–78.84×) (Extended Data Fig. 3). The viral load in the BALF sample was estimated by qPCR to be 3.95 × 108 copies per ml (Extended Data Fig. 4).</text>

      <text>A 47-year-old woman from Wuhan, Hubei province, China, presented to an emergency department in Melbourne, Australia. Her symptoms commenced 4 d earlier with lethargy, sore throat, dry cough, pleuritic chest pain, mild dyspnea and subjective fevers (Fig. 1a). She traveled from Wuhan to Australia 11 d before presentation. She had no contact with the Huanan seafood market or with known COVID-19 cases. She was otherwise healthy and was a non-smoker taking no medications. Clinical examination revealed a temperature of 38.5 °C, a pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 140/80 mm Hg, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% while breathing ambient air. Lung auscultation revealed bi-basal rhonchi. At presentation on day 4, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a nasopharyngeal swab specimen by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR. SARS-CoV-2 was again detected at days 5–6 in nasopharyngeal, sputum and fecal samples, but was undetectable from day 7 (Fig. 1a). Blood C-reactive protein was elevated at 83.2, with normal counts of lymphocytes (4.3 × 109 cells per liter (range, 4.0 × 109 to 12.0 × 109 cells per liter)) and neutrophils (6.3 × 109 cells per liter (range, 2.0 × 109 to 8.0 × 109 × 109 cells per liter)). No other respiratory pathogens were detected. Her management was intravenous fluid rehydration without supplemental oxygenation. No antibiotics, steroids or antiviral agents were administered. Chest radiography demonstrated bi-basal infiltrates at day 5 that cleared on day 10 (Fig. 1b). She was discharged to home isolation on day 11. Her symptoms resolved completely by day 13, and she remained well at day 20, with progressive increases in plasma SARS-CoV-2-binding IgM and IgG antibodies from day 7 until day 20 (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1). The patient was enrolled through the Sentinel Travelers Research Preparedness Platform for Emerging Infectious Diseases novel coronavirus substudy (SETREP-ID-coV) and provided written informed consent before the study. Patient care and research were conducted in compliance with the Case Report guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Experiments were performed with ethics approvals HREC/17/MH/53, HREC/15/MonH/64/2016.196 and UoM#1442952.1/#1443389.4.</text>

      <text>We analyzed the kinetics and breadth of immune responses associated with clinical resolution of COVID-19. As ASCs are key for the rapid production of antibodies following infection with Ebola virus and infection with and vaccination against influenza virus, and activated circulating TFH cells (cTFH cells) are concomitantly induced following vaccination against influenza virus, we defined the frequency of CD3–CD19+CD27hiCD38hi ASC and CD4+CXCR5+ICOS+PD-1+ cTFH cell responses before symptomatic recovery. ASCs appeared in the blood at the time of viral clearance (day 7; 1.48%) and peaked on day 8 (6.91%). The emergence of cTFH cells occurred concurrently in blood at day 7 (1.98%), increasing on day 8 (3.25%) and day 9 (4.46%) (Fig. 1d). The peak of both ASCs and cTFH cells was markedly higher in the patient with COVID-19 than in healthy control participants (0.61% ± 0.40% and 1.83% ± 0.77%, respectively (average ± s.d.); n = 5). Both ASCs and cTFH cells were prominently present during convalescence (day 20) (4.54% and 7.14%, respectively; Fig. 1d). Thus, our study provides evidence on the recruitment of both ASCs and cTFH cells in this patient’s blood while she was still unwell and 3 d before the resolution of symptoms.</text>

      <text>Since co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR is the key phenotype of the activation of CD8+ T cells in response to viral infections, we analyzed co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR. As per reports for Ebola and influenza, co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR on CD8+ T cells (assessed as the frequency of CD38+HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cells) rapidly increased in this patient from day 7 (3.57%) to day 8 (5.32%) and day 9 (11.8%), then decreased at day 20 (7.05%) (Fig. 1e). Furthermore, the frequency of CD38+HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cells was much higher in this patient than in healthy individuals (1.47% ± 0.50%; n = 5). CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells were also recently documented in a patient with COVID-19 at one time point. Similarly, co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR on CD4+ T cells (assessed as the frequency of CD38+HLA-DR+ CD4+ T cells) increased between day 7 (0.55%) and day 9 (3.33%) in this patient, relative to that of healthy donors (0.63% ± 0.28%; n = 5), although at lower levels than that of CD8+ T cells. CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, produced larger amounts of granzymes A and B and perforin (~34–54% higher) than did their parent cells (CD8+ or CD4+ populations; Fig. 1e). Thus, the emergence and rapid increase in activated CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, at days 7–9 preceded the resolution of symptoms. Details on data reproducibility are in the Life Sciences Reporting Summary.</text>

      <text>In a recent study done by Michael et al, they introduced a method to score the severity of inflammation on CT images based on summing up degree of acute lung inflammation lesions involvement of each lobe (including ground-glass opacity or consolidation or other fuzzy interstitial opacities). We used the same method to quantify pulmonary inflammation and correlate to the clinical classifications. There was significant difference in scores between common type and severe-critical type (p &lt; 0.001). However, there was also a score overlap between the two groups, which showed that 8 cases in the common type had a higher score, and 5 cases in the severe-critical type had a lower score. Among 8 cases of common type, 7 cases had fibrotic lesions which indicated that the lesions began to be repaired, and all of the 8 patients were less than 70 years old (range 36–65, average 52.5 years), none of them had pulmonary complications. The specific situation of 5 patients in a severe-critical type which had a lower score was as follows: 3 of the 5 patients were over 70 years old; among them, 1 patient was a female smoker with diabetes, aged 80 years old, with moderate emphysema and a small amount of pleural effusion; 1 patient was a 70-year-old female, with emphysema and a small amount of pleural effusion as well; the other one was 75-year-old female with high blood pressure; the forth case was a 44-year-old male without any underlying disease; however, CT images showed only progressive lesions such as ground-glass opacification and consolidation without any fibrotic lesions (Fig. 5). The last case was a 58-year-old female without any underlying disease; further analysis was needed to find out the cause of clinical severity. Overall, we believe that many factors, such as advanced age, underlying diseases, and pleural effusions, would relate to the clinical severity, which call for a comprehensive evaluation.</text>

      <text>Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were performed for all patients on the day of diagnosis. Initially, six patients (60%) were noted to have a bilateral distribution of patchy shadows or ground glass opacity except in four patients (patients 2, 4, 6, and 7) (Table 4). Patients received serial CT scans in the follow up or according to clinical condition changes afterwards. Patient 2 was found to have multiple patchy ground-glass opacities in both lungs in a CT scan on day four after admission, and patient 7 presented with multiple patchy lesions in bilateral lungs day 10 after admission. In contrast, there were two patients (20%) (patients 4 and 6) who had no radiological evidence of pneumonia during hospitalization. In total, eight (80%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia (100%). No pneumothorax or pleural effusion occurred in any patient. The evolution of CT images in one patient (patient 5) is illustrated in Figure 3, which shows the serial change of lung lesions.</text>

      <text>About 75% of cases of COVID-19 have been reported with bilateral pneumonia, while bilateral pneumonia was noted in 80% of our cases. The primary findings in CT images of COVID-19 patients were as follow : ground glass opacities (GGO), inter- or intra-lobular septal thickening, and air space consolidation. Lung abnormalities on chest CT images were reported to show the greatest severity approximately 10 days after the initial onset of symptoms while consolidation could increase up to two weeks and be gradually absorbed. Fibrous stripes were recognized upon improvement in the disease course. These features were mostly in line with our cases (Figure 3). Notably, a few slightly enlarged lymph nodes were found in the mediastinum in two of the 10 cases (patients 5 and 7), which the enlargement subsided in the fourth CT performed on day 21 after symptom onset in patient 5. Reactive lymphadenopathy due to infection might be one of the explanations.</text>

      <text>A total of 456 pulmonary lesions were detected by CT in 44 patients, of them 1 patient had no lesions (2.3%), five had solitary focal lesion (11.4%), seventeen had more than 10 lesions (38.6%). The lesions number of type I was 127 (27.85%), type II 286 (62.72%), type III 22 (4.82%), type IV 21 (4.61%). The lesions were mainly distributed in the peripheral (92.11%) and posterior part (71.71%, type I: 51.17%) of the lung. The size of type I was 1.37±1.08 cm (range, 0.34–8.53 cm), significantly smaller than that of type II (2.12±2.00 cm, 0.3–13.53 cm, p&lt;0.001), but no statistically difference with type IV (1.52±0.88 cm, 0.38–3.12 cm, p=0.2553). The size of type II was significantly smaller than that of type III (4.7±2.58 cm, 1.36–11.90 cm, p&lt;0.001), but no statistically difference with type IV (p=0.4632). The size of type III was also significantly larger than that of type IV (p&lt;0.001). The CT score was 38.44±34.56 (range, 0–136.13). Finally, there were 11 indicators in the multiple linear regression model (abnormal rate ≥40%; without multicollinearity; indicators: lymphocyte, CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, CRP, TP, ALB, ALB/GLB, PAB, LDH, HDL, LDL) to evaluate their linear relation to the CT score. The adjusted R2 was 0.509. Only CD4+ T cell (B=−25.738, p=0.018), CRP (B=20.565, p=0.044) and LDH (B=23.201, p=0.010) got statistically significance of the linear regression with CT score. 28.95% lesions were with vessel expansion, while 40.13% with air bronchogram. 6.82% patients had mediastinal lymphadenopathy, while 6.82% patients had pleural effusion (bilateral: 2/44; unilateral: 1/44). All patients obtained follow-up CT at least once. During our study period, we recorded all patients' first follow-up CT (interval of 2–7 days; median, 4 days). 81.82% patients showed lesions progression, while 13.64% patients showed lesion absorption. We also achieved a patient's first and twice follow-up CT (fig. 1). </text>

      <text>After discharge, the patient’s temperature was still abnormal, accompanied by dizziness and headache. Thus, he re-visited our hospital and was admitted again on January 28. Considering the previous detection of 2019-nCoV-RNA in throat swabs, we recollected throat swab as well as deep sputum samples. Undoubtedly, 2019-nCoV-RNA was detected in sputum at this time. On January 28, a slight aggravation of pneumonia was reported; antiviral drug lopinavir/ritonavir (two tablets twice a day) was prescribed. After 3 days’ therapy, the situation of pneumonia became worse; thus, methylprednisolone (40 mg intravenous drip for 3 consecutive days) and aerosol interferon therapies (5 million units per time for 3 consecutive days) were added. As expected, pneumonia improved significantly. On February 8, 2019-nCoV-RNA were all negative in throat swabs, sputum, blood, and feces (Fig. 1b). On February 9, he had a normal temperature without respiratory symptoms for at least 10 days, and 2019-nCoV-RNA was still negative in feces. Thus, he was discharged and asked to observe at home for 2 weeks. The detailed clinical information was shown in Fig. 1. During hospitalization, the results of noninvasive finger pulse oxygen saturation were in normal range, even when there is significant progress of pneumonia in chest CT.</text>

      <text>The familial cluster of five patients (index patient to patient 4) was infected with COVID-19, and just the index patient had been to Wuhan, who had no symptoms before his family members started to get sick one after another. On January 19, the index patient, a 48-year-old male, came back to Beijing from Wuhan. He invited his nephew (patient 3) for dinner. On January 22, patient 3, a 32-year-old man, became ill with continuous high fever and fatigue; the highest body temperature was 40.2 °C; he first visited a hospital on January 24. Two nasopharyngeal swabs sample were obtained and were found to be positive for COVID-19 on the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Before he went to the hospital, his uncle (index patient) was informed that his relative in Wuhan had been infected with COVID-19. On January 23, the index patient’s wife, patient 1, a 45-year-old female, had a fever of 37.8 °C too. For the reason that his relative in Wuhan and nephew had been detected to be infected with COVID-19, his family visited a hospital together and tested the RT-PCR for COVID-19, the results of which were all positive (Fig. 1). The chest radiograph of patient 2 was normal, and it is noteworthy that she was an asymptomatic too. The index patient’s and his wife’s (patient 1) chest radiograph demonstrated ground glass opacities (Fig. 2). Then, the family were transferred by EMS to the designated hospitals for special treatment and isolated on January 27. On the same day, the nephew’s mother (patient 4) got a fever of 38.4 with joint pain; after being confirmed with COVID-19 infection, she was transferred to the designated hospital too. On February 18, 2020, index patient to patient 2 were discharged, the index patient had no fever along with dry cough, and patient 2 had no clinical symptoms during hospitalization, while patients 3 and 4 were still in hospital. </text>

      <text>Many patients with positive nucleic acid tests do not have the typical imaging findings of 2019-nCoV pneumonia (Fig 3 ), and patients with negative nucleic acid tests may have typical imaging findings. However, during the isolation period, a second nucleic acid test result may become positive. Therefore, patients with positive nucleic acid tests or typical imaging findings are sent to a designated infectious disease hospital for isolation, observation, and treatment. If the imaging diagnosis is ignored, it may greatly threaten medical personnel and the public.</text>

      <text>On admission, 203 patients manifested bilateral pneumonia in X-ray or chest computed tomography (Fig. 2 ) and 39 patients showed unilateral lesion. CT scan result was normal in another 6 patients. Of the 248 patients with repeated radiology examination, the image showed progression in 163 (65.7%) patients after a median of 3 days (that is the 7th day after onset of symptoms), including three patients whose images were normal on admission. The images presented shifting of radiological lesions, which was characterized by improvement of original lesions together with the appearance of new lesions. Some patients showed worsening of original lesions with or without development of new lesions. Images presented disease relief in 56(22.6%) patients and stable condition in 30(12.1%) patients, respectively. Among those patients with radiological worsening, 91 patients did another radiological examination after a median of 6 days (median 14 days after onset of symptoms). 154(94.5%) patients at this point showed improvement, while 1(0.6%) and 8(4.9%) patients showed stable condition and deterioration in images, respectively.</text>

      <text>Among 50 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, nine mild patients were negative in CT pulmonary imaging (Fig. 1 ), including five cases below the age of 18 years, suggesting that children, teenagers and younger patients were mostly mild. Among 41 common, severe and critically severe patients who had positive pulmonary imaging (Table 2 , Figs. 2 –6), the lesion was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22, right lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36, suggesting bilateral lower lobes as the mostly infected while the right middle lobe the least infected. Most of the patients had involvement of over two lobes, and single lobe involvement was only in two cases in the right lower lobe, with the lesion within lobes being mostly multiple (Table 3 ). Severe and critically severe NCP involved most commonly 4–5 lobes and most significantly (P&lt;0.05) bilateral lower and upper lobes compared with common NCP (Table 3, Table 4 ). The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension towards the pulmonary hilum in big lesions (Table 5 ). Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15.</text>

      <text>On CT imaging, common NCP was mostly at the early stage with bilaterally scattered irregular patches of ground glass opacity. Some lesions might have a mixed pattern of consolidation in the center and ground glass opacity in the peripheral like a “halo sign”. The lesion density was mostly non-uniform with air bronchogram and thickened interlobular or intralobular septa. In severe or critically severe patients, multiple patches or an integrated larger patch of ground glass opacity, consolidation or mixed consolidation and ground glass opacity might present in bilateral lungs, with these three imaging manifestations being possibly presented in one patient at the same time. Consolidation and thickened interlobular septa were presented in severe or critically severe patients more than common ones, suggesting progression of the disease. The lesion was mostly located in the peripheral area under the pleura but might extend towards the center in bigger lesions, and peripheral lesions with involvement of the center were mostly seen in severe and critically severe patients. Four to ten days after treatment in this series, repeated CT scanning revealed that most lesions were absorbed and improved with reduced extent, decreased density and formation of fibrotic stripes (Fig. 2 –6 ). In one common patient, the lesion in the right lower lobe was improved four days after treatment, however, a new lesion appeared in the left lower lobe which was improved after treatment for three additional days (Fig. 3). This might indicate that the lesion might change rapidly in a short period of time and repeated CT scanning could provide basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment.</text>

      <text>Chest CT of a male patient, 37 years old. This individual came back from Wuhan to Wenzhou on January 19th. He presented with cough and expectoration. He underwent a chest CT examination on January 24th, which showed subtle peripheral ground glass opacity in the middle lobe, and right inferior lobe. He was hospitalized on the same day. The RT-PCR test was done and was found to be positive. The CT images of January 27th and February 2nd showed a significant increase of lesion number and density, especially in the both lower lobes. Two RT-PCR tests were performed on February 4th and 7th and both results were negative. The CT images of February 7th showed a decrease in density of the pulmonary lesions. On the CT examination of February 15th, the lesions were absorbed and the patient was discharged. During the hospitalization, the patient had arbidol as antiviral treatment and nasal spray of interferon, no oxygen therapy was performed since the oxygen saturation of the patient remained normal. The patient had no fever during the entire disease course.</text>

      <text>In conclusion, most patients from Wenzhou city, Zhejiang province presented mild infection in our study. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral GGO, mixed GGO or consolidation with predominance in the lower lung, more extensive mixed opacity than GGO and consolidation is highly suspicious of COVID-19 infection during the outbreak in the first week of disease onset. Some patients with COVID-19 can present with normal chest findings, suggesting that a normal chest CT scan cannot exclude the diagnosis of COVID-19 (Fig. 1 ).</text>

      <text>Patients with COVID-19 infection present with pneumonia (ie, fever, cough, and dyspnea). Although fatigue is common, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and diarrhea uncommonly occur. A recent report in The Lancet described the clinical manifestations of NCIP in 41 patients. According to that report, abnormal chest imaging findings were observed in all patients, with 40 having bilateral disease at initial imaging. This early report on the presentation of the NCIP in intensive care unit patients indicated bilateral subsegmental areas of air-space consolidation, whereas in non–intensive care unit patients, transient areas of subsegmental consolidation are seen early, with bilateral ground-glass opacities being predominant later in the course of the disease (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3 ). Serial chest radiography of a 61-year-old man who died of NCIP showed progressively worsening bilateral consolidation during a course of 7 days. Another report on 99 individuals with confirmed NCIP described similar imaging findings, with bilateral lung involvement in 75% and unilateral involvement in 25%. Another study of five individuals in a family cluster with NCIP described bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities, with more extensive involvement of lungs parenchyma in older family members. The reported imaging features most closely resemble those of MERS and SARS. No pleural effusion or cavitation has been reported so far in confirmed cases of NCIP, but pneumothorax was reported in 1% of patients (1 of 99) in a study by Chen et al. Overall, the imaging findings are highly nonspecific and might overlap with the symptoms of H1N1 influenza, cytomegalovirus pneumonia, or atypical pneumonia. The acute clinical presentation and history of contact with a COVID-19-infected patient or history of recent travel to an eastern Asian country (eg, China, South Korea, or Japan) should raise clinical suspicion for the diagnosis of NCIP. Although further investigations on the clinical and radiologic aspects of the COVID-19 are ongoing, imaging will continue to be a crucial component in patient management.</text>

      <text>We also analyzed the density characteristics of each lesion, as detailed in Table 5 . GGO is a commonly observed HRCT finding in lung lesions in patients (Fig. 1 ). In this study, the most common lesions, 342 (48.8%), were GGO with a crazy paving pattern or interlobular septa thickening were the most common (Fig. 2 ). The relative representation of GGO with a crazy paving and interlobular septal thickening were more common in group C and D than in groups A(P = 0.002, P = 0.003) and B (P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.001). The density characteristics of the lesions were not significantly different between groups A and B, and between groups C and D (P &gt; 0.05). In addition, there was no statistically significant difference among PGGO, mixed GGO with consolidation &lt;50% and mixed GGO with consolidation ≥50% (Fig. 3, Fig. 4 ), with complete consolidation (Fig. 5 ) in the different age groups (P &gt; 0.05).</text>

      <text>A 64-year-old woman presented to the emergency department on February 1st, 2020, because of a 7-day fever, with the highest body temperature of 38.7 °C, accompanied by cough with a little sputum and muscle soreness, but no chest distress or dyspnea. She just flew back to Hangzhou, China, from Malaysia 7 days ago. Physical examination revealed no dry and moist rales in both lungs with a temperature of 37.3 °C, heart rate of 92 beats/min, respiratory rate of 18 times/min, and blood pressure of 113/79 mmHg. Her laboratory tests showed white blood cell count (WBC) was 2.5 × 109 cells/mL with 63.3% neutrophils and 29.2% lymphocytes, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 3.62 mg/L. Her sputum test for influenza A + B (real-time fluorescent RT-PCR) was negative, and the lung CT images were shown in Fig. 1. The lung CT images of this patient showed multiple ground-glass shadows with unclear edges and uneven densities in the peripheral and posterior lungs, mainly under the pleura. These imagings were in accordance with the early radiographic features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Later, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) RNA was detected in the sputum by real-time fluorescent RT-PCR, and the patient was diagnosed as COVID-19.</text>

      <text>A 47-year-old man had a history of cough, sputum production, sore throat and throbbing headache for 3 days without fever. He has been living in Chengdu, Sichuan province, for a long time. However, his mother had traveled to Wuhan a week ago and was diagnosed with the new coronavirus after she got back home. He has referred to the emergency department of our institution on 2 February 2020. General physical examination showed that moist rales were audible over both lungs, and the body temperature was 36.7°C, and other results were unremarkable. The laboratory tests showed that white blood cell count kept in the normal range (5.11 × 109/l), and the differential count showed decreased lymphocyte (16.8%, normal range 20–50%) and increased C-reactive protein (22.50 mg/l; normal range &lt;5 mg/l). Chest computed tomography (CT) (2 February 2020) showed that there were ground-glass opacities, consolidation or both in bilateral lungs (Figure 1A). Considering the contact history with his mother and the CT features, a real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction of the patient’s throat swab was performed, and the patient was confirmed with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection.</text>

      <text>After receiving 3 days of treatment with an antiviral (Veletonavir), and anti-inflammatory (Methylprednisolone), the patient’s cough was relieved, and repeated chest CT (5 February 2020) showed the extent and density of lesions were significantly decreased (Figure 1B). Laboratory tests, however, showed that lymphocytes were still reduced, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was increased.</text>

      <text>On 6 February 2020, the patient began to have a fever (body temperature 38.6°C) then additional antibiotics (Piperacillin–tazobactam) was given. Unfortunately, 2 days later, the patient’s body temperature reached a maximum of 39.0°C, accompanied by a paroxysmal cough, and the whole body’s skin was flushing. CT images (9 February 2020) manifested as extensive ground-glass opacities, consolidation in bilateral lungs. Oddly, compared with CT images of the last two times (Figure 1C), all the lesions were found in different locations (Figure 1D). On 11 February 2020, he received a real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction of the throat swab again, and the results were still positive.</text>

On the basis of the average Likert scale, the two radiologists assessed for the overall subjective image quality a median point value of 4 for both the protocols. As expected, the subjective image noise had a trend to be worse in the LDCT. However, the LDCT demonstrated a significant reduction in the motion artifacts when compared to the standard DECT (4 vs. 5) (Fig. 1a, b).

The feasibility, the quality and the diagnostic performance of ultra-low-dose chest CT with spectral shaping, and other technical solutions have already been demonstrated sometimes with questionable results about the pathological findings. To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating a long-pitch, dual-source acquisition with spectral shaping in acute setting in patients with COVID-19. As expected from a low-dose acquisition, the LDCT images had trend, though poorly significant, to be evaluated as more noisy than the HD-DECT images (Table 4).

      <text>The quantitative analysis found significant differences in SNR and CNR for several anatomical structures, as expected when comparing a standard-dose and an ultra-low-dose acquisition with an ultra-long pitch. However, these differences had poor significance in the evaluation of lung SNR and CNR, in agreement to the subjective analysis. Again, this can be explained by considering the relatively high mean energy of the 100Sn kVp spectrum contributing to lowering the noise together with the radiation dose (Table 2, Fig. 2). Moreover, in this protocol, the reconstructions have been kept as similar as possible, in particular the slice thickness, the slice spacing and the iterative reconstructions while for LDCT a slightly softer kernel was used. Again, in Table 4, the image sharpness of LDCT was comparable with maintained diagnostic reliability. Further studies are necessary to fully explore the role of iterative reconstructions at lower doses in this acute setting.</text>

      <text>Unenhanced chest CT showed patchy shadow in upper lobe tongue segment of the left lung (Fig. 1 a). Repeat chest CT showed the lesion had quick changes with formation of new lesions in other areas and extended from the peripheral to the central area suggesting progression of the disease on day 5 (Fig. 1b). After 14 days of therapy, the follow-up CT showed partial resolution and partially added of patchy consolidations and ground-glass opacities in both lungs (Fig. 1c). Real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction of the patient's oropharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid on 2, 5, 11, 14 days after hospitalization, respectively.</text>

      <text>As shown in Figure 1 , ground glass opacities on chest CT were the most common radiologic findings, followed by consolidation. All of the five patients were transferred to a designated hospital after diagnosis to continue hemodialysis. Two of them received intermittent nasal catheter oxygen inhalation as well as treatment with daily 40 mg methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin. Two patients were given antiviral treatment with abidol and ribavirin injection, respectively. Up to the end of this study, none of them had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, or other serious complications.</text>

      <text>The lung field was divided into the peripheral zone and the central zone according to the halfway point of the distance from the chest wall of the same layer to the hilum of the lung. The zone near the lung hilum is the central zone, and the zone far from the hilum is the peripheral zone. Lesions located between the two zones or covering both zones were recorded as involving both zones. In the present study, the lung lesions of 48 cases (43.6%) were located in the peripheral zone and lesions of 62 cases (56.4%) involved both the peripheral and the central zones (Fig 1 ).</text>

      <text>There were specific signs seen at CT comprising (1) the batwing sign: a large symmetrical shadow around the bilateral lung hila, which looks like bat or butterfly wings; (2) the white lung sign: also known as “blizzard lung”, showing diffusely distributed flocculent, nodular, and flaky high-density shadows in both lungs, which partially merge and consolidate; (3) the Rosa roxburghii sign: demonstrating semi-round GGO distributed in the periphery zone of lung lobes, which look like the rose, Rosa roxburghii; (4) the gypsum sign: manifesting as patchy consolidation in the lung lobes with different densities. Among these signs, an isolated batwing sign or multiple Rosa roxburghii signs are characteristic CT manifestations of the disease (Fig 4 ).</text>

      <text>On 20 January, 2020, a 27-yr-old woman with a pregnancy of 36 weeks and 5 days was admitted to Wuhan Red Cross Hospital because of fever. Four days later, the condition of the patient worsened as oxygen saturation was 92–93% whilst breathing ambient air and reduced fetal movement was reported. B-ultrasound revealed that there was little amniotic fluid and intrauterine distress was possible. Considering her physical condition, an emergent Caesarean delivery was decided. Physical examination at admission revealed a body temperature of 37.9°C, BP of 110/80 mm Hg, HR of 98 beats min−1, and ventilatory frequency of 22 bpm. Dry and wet pulmonary rales were observed on bilateral lung auscultation. The laboratory results were haemoglobin 104 g L−1, white blood cells 5.31 (×109 L−1), neutrophils 4.48 (×109 L−1), lymphocytes 0.74 g L−1, and C-reactive protein 99.6 mg L−1, whilst other blood biochemical and coagulation parameters were within normal limits. The SARS-CoV-2 testing was positive in the sample of oropharyngeal swabs by rRT–PCR assay, whereas other viral respiratory pathogens were all negative. Chest CT indicated multiple patchy lung consolidation bilaterally and ground-glasslike opacities around the border, and the subpleural distribution was dominant, which are the typical manifestations of COVID-19 (Fig. 1 ). </text>

      <text>On admission to our hospital, the infant appeared well with a body weight of 6·5 kg, an axillary temperature of 36·5°C, and a respiratory rate of 45 breaths per min. She did not have dyspnea, wheezing, or chest retraction. Her oxygen saturation was at 98% while she was breathing ambient air. Chest auscultation revealed normal breath sounds without rhonchi nor crepitations. Her heart rate was 140 beats per min without murmur. Other physical exams revealed unremarkable findings. A chest radiograph was normal, except for a mild enlargement of mediastinum shadow (figure 1 ). Cardiac ultrasound revealed no abnormalities. Laboratory examination showed a total white blood cell count of 10·23 × 109 cells per L, a absolute neutrophil count of 1·19 × 109 per L, a lymphocyte cell count of 8·3 × 109 cell per L, a platelet count of 230 × 109 cells per L, and a haemoglobin concentration of 112 g/L. The patient's serum C-reactive protein and procalcitonin concentrations were 0·32 mg/L and 0·08 ng/mL, respectively. Her serum creatine kinase (224 U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (327 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (59·9 U/L), and alanine aminotransferase (34·8 U/L) levels were measured. The patient's serum creatinine concentration was 36·5 μmol/L. The screening laboratory tests for immunodeficiency were unremarkable. Assays for influenza viruses and a respiratory panel were negative. The infant was isolated with her mother. The infant's mother was advised to wear a surgical face mask, practiced hand hygiene, and continued to breastfeed the infant. The baby received azithromycin at a dose of 10 mg/kg per day orally for 5 days. Her condition had been stable during hospitalisation. Repeated real-time RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs were negative on Feb 14 and Feb 17. The infant was discharged from hospital on Feb 20.</text>

      <text>Fever and myalgia developed in the woman on January 25, a total of 5 days after she returned to Taiwan from Wuhan. She reported that she did not have cough, dyspnea, chest pain, or diarrhea. Chest radiography showed diffuse infiltrates in the bilateral lower lungs (Figure 1A). Assays to detect influenza viruses and a respiratory panel to detect adenovirus, human rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were all negative. A throat swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse-transcription–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays on January 27; this was the fifth confirmed imported case of Covid-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection) in Taiwan.</text>

      <text>Throat swabs obtained from the patient tested positive for 2019-nCoV on real-time reverse-transcription–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays. On admission to the hospital, the man was isolated and treated empirically with antiviral agents, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and supportive therapies. Chest radiographs obtained on admission showed an infiltrate in the upper lobe of the left lung (Figure 1A). On January 25, he received supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute because of increasing dyspnea with hypoxemia. The partial pressure of oxygen was 57.2 mm Hg while he was breathing ambient air, and a progressive infiltrate and consolidation were observed on chest radiographs (Figure 1B through 1D). His fever disappeared on January 25, and his clinical condition has improved since January 26. His wife had no symptoms of illness while they were traveling. She was healthy as of January 28.</text>

      <text>Garlic (Allium sativum L.) (cf. Figure 1) is considered as an important herb thanks to its variety of uses, including either a common spice for family meals or a popular component in folk-medicine prescriptions. For thousands of years, garlic has been used as a medication for common colds, influenza, and other kinds of infections. Recent pharmacological studies indicate that essential oil of garlic is an exceptional source of organosulfur compounds, possessing strong antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, and antimicrobial properties. The oil is also proven to be conducive to hypoglycemia, hypotension, antithrombotic, immunomodulatory, and prebiotic therapy. Besides, allicin is a typical reactive sulfur species found in the essential oil.</text>

      <text>We report a 58-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with a 1-day history of fever, sore throat and fatigue 5 days after visiting Wuhan, China (the epicenter of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia outbreak). Physical examination of the lungs at admission was normal. Laboratory studies demonstrated the white blood cell count (4.3 × 109/L) and blood procalcitonin level were also normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was slightly increased at 23 mm/h (normal range, 0–20 mm/h). A swab test and chest CT scanning were performed. Chest CT images illustrated multiple patchy, cloud-like high-density shadows in the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (Fig. 1 a and c). Three real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of the oropharyngeal swab specimens were negative for the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid.</text>

Given the negative rRT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 on illness day 21 and 23, there were persistent milder bilateral lung opacities on the chest radiograph on illness day 25 (Fig. 2d) which were corresponding to bilateral ill-defined GGO patches with or without reticulation, and mild fibrotic change on CT two days later (Fig. 3).

      <text>The index patient, a 64-year-old woman, attended the Department of Accident and Emergency at 23:42 h on 1st February 2020 with fever, productive cough and breathlessness for 2 days. She developed flu-like symptoms on 24th January 2020 with transient improvement after taking antibiotics and symptomatic treatment prescribed by a general practitioner. However, her fever relapsed on 30th January 2020 with productive cough and dyspnea. She had no history of travel in the preceding month, but she owned a fashion boutique with many mainland Chinese customers owing to its proximity to the West Kowloon high-speed rail station. On admission, she had a fever of 39.6°C with sinus tachycardia of 126 bpm and blood pressure of 198/92 mmHg. She was tachypnoeic with oxygen saturation of 80% in room air. Bilateral crepitations were heard on auscultation and chest X-ray revealed multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrates (Figure 2 (a)). In the absence of history of travel to China or contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient, she was admitted to ward A in an open cubicle under standard precautions for community-acquired pneumonia (6 ACH, normal pressure setting) at 01:22 h on 2nd February 2020. She could not wear a surgical mask as she was on oxygen therapy through a simple facemask (Soundway®, Ningbo Shengyurui Medical Appliances Co. Ltd, Ningbo, China; Figure 2(b)). She also had frequent coughs while residing in the ward. She became more hypoxic around 18:00 h and required an increase in oxygen therapy to 8 L/min, delivered through the same facemask. On 3rd February 2020, she was transferred to an AIIR at 12:35 h and was electively intubated at 13:00 h for progressive respiratory failure. Nasopharyngeal swab for multiplex PCR FilmArray® RP2 panel (Biofire Diagnostics, bioMérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile, France), urine for BinaxNOW Legionella and pneumococcal antigen (Abbott, IL, USA) were negative. The patient was tested for COVID-19 as enhanced laboratory surveillance on 3rd February 2020, where both combined NPA with throat swab, and tracheal aspirate showed detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with a Ct value of 22.8 and 26.1, respectively. The patient was subsequently transferred to the Infectious Diseases Centre, Princess Margaret Hospital, for further management.</text>

Thereafter, he was transferred immediately to the superior hospital, and chest CT showed patchy ground-glass opacity in the upper lobe of the left lung on admission (Fig. 1b), and it rapidly progressed to segmental mixed consolidation and ground glass opacification with air-bronchogram 3 days after admission (Fig. 1c), and it resolved in left upper lobe and also showed multifocal ground-glass opacities 7 days after admission (Fig. 1d1, axial image; Fig. 1d2, ray-summation image; Fig. 1d3, pseudo color MIP; Fig. 1d4, coronal image), and they resolved within 2 weeks (Fig. 1e, coronal image). Fortunately, this patient was diagnosed as "presumed cases" based on early CT findings, the patient was immediately isolated for clinical monitoring so as not to cause regional spread. The fifth RT-PCR test was positive on the fifth day after admission; this patient was finally confirmed as COVID-19. Serial imaging studies in the Fig. 1d, e illustrated that the patient recovered after treatment.</text>

      <text>Since the initial reports of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in December 2019, in Wuhan, China, an increasing number of cases is being detected every day in different countries. Soon after the outbreak, and because of rapidly spreading disease, various protective measures against the coronavirus have been introduced; however, some have no scientific basis. The widespread practice of spraying sanitizers and alcohol in the air, on roads, vehicles, and personnel which is used in many places has no value. In fact, alcohol and disinfectants in large quantity, are potentially harmful to human and should be avoided. Unfortunately, following the spread of COVID-19 in Iran, a false rumor has circulated that drinking alcohol is beneficial in preventing or curing a possible infection. This was followed shortly by a load of patients referring to the emergency departments, intoxicated by alcohol consumption as a failed attempt to prevent infection. There are severe restrictions on the production and consumption of alcoholic beverages in IRAN, as in many other Islamic countries, and many are the victims of illicitly produced liquor containing methanol. Figure 1 a is an axial nonenhanced brain computed tomography scan of a case with methanol poisoning. The image demonstrates bilateral symmetrical decreased density of lentiform nuclei, especially putamina, and massive hemorrhage in the left lentiform nucleus. Axial T2 weighted MR images of the brain (Fig 1b) in a second case reveals a symmetrical increased signal intensity of basal ganglia. Brain imaging manifestations of methanol poisoning have been described in the literature. Bilateral necrosis of basal ganglia is one of the most common radiologic features. Putaminal involvement is regarded as characteristics possibly either due to decreased blood flow through the basal vein of Rosenthal as the result of hypotension or accumulation of high concentrations of formic acid. The changes are best depicted by magnetic resonance imaging, with characteristic increased signal intensity on T2-weighted sequence. Diffusion-weighted imaging is also helpful in elucidating the cytotoxic edema. In later stages, the resorption of infarcted putamen results in cystic cavities at the site of injury. Although such radiologic manifestations are typical for methanol poisoning, there are other conditions that may result in similar findings. Wilson's disease, Leigh disease, hypoxic-ischemic injury, and carbon monoxide poisoning are other possible radiological differential diagnoses. Methanol intoxication is mainly caused by methanol ingestion, however, poisoning through inhalation or skin absorption has also been reported. Upon metabolization of methanol to formic acid, in toxic concentration, neurological signs and symptoms will occur. These include different degrees of decrease in the level of consciousness, headache, vertigo, and impaired vision. Treatment includes the administration of an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, such as fomepizole or ethanol. Controversy exists about the value of hemodialysis, restricting it to specific cases especially in severe intoxication.</text>

      <text>A subpleural lesion is defined as a lesion located no more than 1 cm from the pleural surface. GGO was defined as subtle GGOs that are seen around the small airways and vessel (Fig 2a). The halo sign was defined as the GGO around a nodule or mass (Fig 4 a). The reversed-halo sign refers to the appearance of a central GGO, which is surrounded by a crescentic- or ring-shaped air-space consolidation (Fig 5 a). The crazy-paving sign refers to the appearance of GGOs with superimposed inter- and intralobular septal thickening (Fig 4b). The sieve-hole sign is a patchy shadow with interlobular septal thickening and bronchodilatation in the transverse section shaped like a sieve (Fig 5b). The cavity sign is a space for gas accumulation, seen as a transparent or low-density region in a mass or nodule in the lung (Fig 5c). The tree -in-bud sign is a branching V- and Y-shaped nodule that resembles the budding branch of a tree (Fig 5d). Bronchodilatation is defined as an increased diameter of bronchus compared to the associated pulmonary artery or the bronchi of similar cross section. Vascular dilatation is defined as increased diameter of a vessel compared to a vessel of similar cross section (Fig 4c). Lymphadenectasis refers to lymph nodes with the diameters &gt;1.5 cm.</text>

      <text>The protocol for this study was approved by the institutional review boards. All patients or their legally authorised representatives provided written informed consent prior to participation in the study. Ninety-three consecutive patients infected with 2019-nCov were enrolled from January 2020 to February 2020. The flowchart of enrolled patients is shown in Fig 1 . Patient baseline clinical and image data were reviewed retrospectively. The inclusion criteria were patients who (a) were positive for nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCov and (b) underwent chest CT. The exclusion criteria were (a) poor images; (b) normal chest CT; and (c) lung abnormalities, such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and bronchiectasis with infection.</text>

      <text>All patients underwent chest CT using a multidetector scanner with the following parameters: display field of view (dFOV) 32 cm, 35 mA, 120 KV, 5 mm section thickness. All CT images were reconstructed with a section thickness of 1.25 mm and reviewed separately by two cardiothoracic radiologists (8 and 15 years of experience). Disagreements were resolved in consensus involving a cardiothoracic radiologist with 17 years of experience). All CT images were evaluated on lung and mediastinal windows for the following features: (1) presence of ground-glass opacity (GGO; Fig 2 ), consolidation (Fig 3 ); (2) presence of nodules or fibrosis; (3) number of lobes with GGO or consolidation; (4) site of the lesions: subpleural or not; (5) presence of the following signs: halo sign, reversed-halo sign, crazy-paving sign, sieve-hole sign, cavity sign, tree-in-bud sign; (6) presence of vascular dilatation, interlobular septal thickening, and bronchodilatation; (7) presence of pleural thickening, pleural effusion; and (8) presence of lymphadenectasis.</text>

      <text>A subpleural lesion is defined as a lesion located no more than 1 cm from the pleural surface. GGO was defined as subtle GGOs that are seen around the small airways and vessel (Fig 2a). The halo sign was defined as the GGO around a nodule or mass (Fig 4 a). The reversed-halo sign refers to the appearance of a central GGO, which is surrounded by a crescentic- or ring-shaped air-space consolidation (Fig 5 a). The crazy-paving sign refers to the appearance of GGOs with superimposed inter- and intralobular septal thickening (Fig 4b). The sieve-hole sign is a patchy shadow with interlobular septal thickening and bronchodilatation in the transverse section shaped like a sieve (Fig 5b). The cavity sign is a space for gas accumulation, seen as a transparent or low-density region in a mass or nodule in the lung (Fig 5c). The tree -in-bud sign is a branching V- and Y-shaped nodule that resembles the budding branch of a tree (Fig 5d). Bronchodilatation is defined as an increased diameter of bronchus compared to the associated pulmonary artery or the bronchi of similar cross section. Vascular dilatation is defined as increased diameter of a vessel compared to a vessel of similar cross section (Fig 4c). Lymphadenectasis refers to lymph nodes with the diameters &gt;1.5 cm.</text>

      <text>Patient 1 was a 72-year-old female with hypertension. She presented to the emergency department with 10 h of fever (maximum temperature of 38.1 °C) and muscle soreness in the late evening of February 2, 2020. The patient’s oxygen saturation was 98% while she was breathing ambient air. A chest CT scan showed ground-glass opacities in the upper lobe of the right lung (Fig. 1). After admission, she initially received antiviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir and aerosol inhalation of interferon-alpha in addition to supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal cannula at 2 L per min. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 because her throat swab sample was nucleic acid–positive for SARS-CoV-2. Laboratory results are summarized in Table 1. On the second hospital day, she developed intermittent atrial fibrillation. She was treated with low dose of betaloc. The patient was still feverish with the maximum temperature of 39 °C, and she received antipyretic therapy. A second chest CT revealed bilateral lung disease with an increasing number of ground-glass opacities and a crazy-paving pattern in February 7. In February 10, she complained of worsening dyspnea. Oxygen saturation decreased to 90–92% while the patient was breathing 10 L of oxygen with the use of an oxygen mask. Blood-gas evaluations showed type I respiratory failure. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) immediately, where she received high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. She was finally intubated and given mechanical ventilation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in February 14. A third chest CT showed decreased ground-glass opacities, and her fever finally resolved in February 19. However, her throat swab sample was still nucleic acid–positive in February 19.</text>

      <text>Patient 2 was a 47-year-old male and the son of patient 1. They presented to the emergency department on February 2, 2020. He complained of a 5-day history of high fever (maximum temperature of 39.2 °C), and cough. A chest CT scan showed bilateral ground-glass opacities with consolidation (Fig. 2). A throat swab nucleic acid test was positive for SARS-CoV-2. After admission, he was also treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and aerosol inhalation of interferon-alpha. However, his condition deteriorated with high fever (40.0 °C) and shortness of breath. A second chest CT showed extensive bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidation in February 8. Blood-gas evaluations showed type I respiratory failure. Then, he was transferred to the ICU with ARDS. The patient’s oxygenation improved with high-flow nasal oxygen. His fever resolved in February 9. His nucleic acid test became negative after February 15. His clinical conditions improved, and he was transferred back to the general ward in February 18. He continued to receive supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal cannula at 2 L per min. His oxygen saturation remained at 98%.</text>

      <text>Patient 3 was a 45-year-old female and the wife of patient 2. They presented to the emergency department on February 2, 2020. She complained of having fever (maximum temperature of 37.7 °C) and cough for 5 days. A chest CT scan showed bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidation in the lower right lobe (Fig. 3). A throat swab sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2. She received lopinavir/ritonavir and aerosol inhalation of interferon-alpha. Her fever resolved from the second hospital day. Results of routine blood counts and blood-gas evaluations were normal. A chest CT scan revealed partial absorption of the lesion in February 14. However, she was still hospitalized due to the persistent positive nucleic acid tests.</text>

      <text>Laboratory findings of these children on admission to hospital are shown in Table 2 . All children showed increased lymphocytes (&gt;4.4 × 109/L) on admission. Only case 1 showed decreased neutrophil count (&lt;1.7 × 109/L), whereas those of the other two children were within normal range. Elevation of platelets was observed in case 1 and case 2. Case 3 had increased levels of procalcitonin (0.73 ng/mL) and C-reaction protein (10.5 mg/L), while serum level of D-dimer (860.0 ng/mL) was found elevated in case 1. Reduced level of serum creatinine was detected in case 1 and case 2 (&lt;41.0 μmol/L). Radiological changes were not typical for COVID-19 in these children (Fig. 2 ). No abnormality on chest radiograph was found in case 3 on admission or during hospitalization. On admission, transverse chest computed tomograms (CT) showed delicate patches of ground glass opacity of lower lobe of right lung in case 1 and consolidation changes of the left lower lobe near the pleura in case 2. Chest X-ray (CXR) taken up on admission showed increased bilateral lung markings in case 1 and patchy shadows over the left lower lung in case 3.</text>

      <text>A 67-year-old woman with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes and end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis therapy for 4 years received a deceased donor kidney transplant in March 2019. Her eGFR was 45 to 55 ml/min per 1.73 m2. She was maintained on tacrolimus with levels between 5 and 8 ng/ml, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 250 mg twice a day (BD), and prednisolone 5 mg OD. Her other medications included ramipril, aspirin, alfacalcidol, and amiloride. She presented on March 5 with cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral patchy consolidation (Figure 1 a). SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase chain reaction tests from nose and throat viral swabs were positive. Bronchial washing for pneumocystis polymerase chain reaction was negative, as was blood polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus DNA. There was no other positive microbiological diagnosis. She was hypoxic with peripheral oxygen saturation of 86% and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min, so she was transferred to intensive therapy unit (ITU) and commenced noninvasive ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure for type 1 respiratory failure) and subsequent intubation and ventilation as her clinical condition deteriorated. Serum CRP on admission was 83 mg/l, hemoglobin 110 g/l, with normal total white cell count, and mild lymphopenia (lymphocyte count 0.8 × 109/l). She was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics. No specific antiviral drugs were given. MMF was ceased. Low-dose tacrolimus was initially continued but stopped 1 day before death. On day 3 post admission, she developed acute kidney injury (AKI), with a serum creatinine increase to 225 μmol/l. She remained stable on the ventilator with reducing oxygen requirements and improvement in lung infiltrates on chest X-ray (Figure 1b) but deteriorated markedly on March 16 with high serum lactate and lactate dehydrogenase levels and an acute rise of CRP to 190. She developed severe metabolic acidosis resistant to correction on continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration, probably owing to an intra-abdominal event (bowel infarction and/or intra-abdominal sepsis). She deteriorated rapidly and died on March 17.</text>

      <text>A chest radiograph was obtained in 23 patients (96%) on ICU admission, and all the radiographs showed bilateral pulmonary opacities. No pleural effusions were seen. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest was obtained in 5 patients (21%); four of the scans showed bilateral ground glass opacities, and one showed pulmonary nodules. Figure 1 provides representative images from a single patient, illustrating the rapid evolution of pulmonary opacities and the diffuse findings. A video showing the CT cross-sectional images of the chest is available at NEJM.org.</text>

      <text>However, awareness of other diseases resulting in such a radiologic pattern is essential when interpreting the CT images. Moreover, there may be some technical issues, resulting in an artifactual ground glass pattern. Figure 1 demonstrates axial chest CT images in a suspected case of COVID-19 infection referred to our center. Irregular zones of ground glass densities are visible in both lower lobes (Fig 1). Based on this finding, the chest CT scan was initially considered consistent with the COVID-19 pneumonia; however, the sagittal and coronal reconstructed images, revealed that the apparent GGOs were in fact caused by linear atelectasis in the bases of both lower lobes in an otherwise normal lung (Fig 2 ). On all images, structures that are partially included within the imaging volume may cause partial volume averaging. The commonest example of this occurs with linear areas of atelectasis and scarring. A thickened interlobar fissure may also result in a similar appearance. When these linear or band-like structures course through the same plane as a CT slice, a ground glass opacity may artifactually form. The cause can usually be recognized by looking at the coronal or sagittal reformats. In most cases, the diagnosis is still evident, as the COVID infection tends to be multifocal, involving multiple segments and lobes, however, more focal lung involvement has also been reported. Therefore, one should be aware of the possibility of this artifact when reporting the axial CT images with limited involvement, especially those cases with focal basal GGO, where linear atelectasis is also common. In such cases correlation with reformatted planes and utilizing thin section reconstructions are recommended to avoid misinterpretation.</text>

      <text>At admission, the most frequent CT finding was GGOs, which were present in 87% and 97% of common and severe type patients, respectively (p = 0.181). A comparison between common and severe type imaging features is presented in Table 2. Consolidation, air bronchogram, white lung appearance, and pleural effusion were more frequently seen in severe patients (p &lt; 0.001), with crazy-paving patterns, linear densities, bronchiectasis, nodules, and tree-in-bud signs also being more frequent. Regarding the repartition, bilateral diffuse involvement was more frequent in severe type, with all 5 lobes’ involvement more frequently seen and higher lobar score severity. Common cases showed more frequent peripheral and lower lung predominance, with limited, focal, or multifocal subsegmental extent. Illustrative cases are presented Fig. 1.</text>

      <text>The first case is a 59 yr old woman with a history of morbid obesity (BMI, 41 kg m−2) who was admitted to a tertiary hospital for acute dyspnoea, myalgia, and arthralgia. Initial physical examination revealed the following: heart rate, 90 beats min−1; arterial blood pressure, 120/70 mm Hg; tachypnoea, 30 min−1; fever of 39.2°C; oxygen saturation, 80%; and bilateral dry rales on lung auscultation. Biological investigation showed a white blood count of 8400 mm−3, lymphopaenia of 800 mm−3, and C reactive protein of 230 ng L−1. Blood gas analysis confirmed severe hypoxaemia with a Pao 2 of 7 kPa and respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.5, HCO3 – 24.8 mM, Paco 2 18 kPa). Chest CT was compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection as it showed bilateral ground-glass like opacities and multiple patchy lung consolidations. Real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The initial medical management consisted of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy (100% oxygen) and administration of lopinavir and ritonavir. On Day 2 after admission, the patient's respiratory condition worsened requiring tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Direct laryngoscopy showed a Grade IV view requiring use of a single bougie (Eschmann introducer, Vygon 15 Fr, Vygon, Écouen, France) without successful intubation. Cervical and thoracic subcutaneous emphysema occurred just after the first attempt during face mask ventilation. The trachea was intubated on the second attempt using another bougie. Mechanical ventilation was then performed with low tidal volume and high positive end expiratory pressure without loss in tidal volume. However, during the first night after intubation, the patient presented with refractory hypoxaemia (Pao 2/Fio 2 at 50) requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and transfer to our tertiary hospital centre. Chest CT scan confirmed a large pneumomediastinum and a right-sided pneumothorax (Fig 1 a). Fibreoptic bronchoscopy confirmed a large perforation of the membranous trachea. As the pneumomediastinum persisted with difficulty in ventilating the patient, she went for surgical tracheal repair with tracheal suture by right thoracotomy, followed by protective ventilation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) under ECMO.</text>

      <text>The second case was a 67 yr old man with a medical history of severe obesity (BMI, 34 kg m−2) who was admitted on March 19, 2020 for dyspnoea and myalgia with onset of symptoms 12 days before admission. Results of his physical examination showed bilateral dry rales on lung auscultation, eupnoea, without signs of acute respiratory failure. Chest CT was compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection with bilateral ground-glass like opacities, patchy lesions, and an extension of lesions exceeding 50%. Initial blood gas analysis showed normoxaemia with a Pao 2 of 19 kPa (oxygen by mask at 6 L min−1), HCO3 – of 26.5 mM, Paco 2 of 4 kPa, and pH 7.4. RT–PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs was positive for SARS-CoV-2. On Day 3 after admission, the patient worsened with acute respiratory failure and oxygen desaturation to 90% with oxygen by mask (9 L min−1). To provide mechanical ventilation and correct hypoxaemia, tracheal intubation was attempted. The first attempt showed a Grade IV view on laryngoscopy requiring use of a bougie (Eschmann introducer, Vygon 15Fr, Vygon) and was unsuccessful. On the second attempt, successful tracheal intubation was performed using videolaryngoscopy (Airtraq®; Prodol Meditec, Guecho, Spain). As the patient presented criteria of severe ARDS according to the Berlin classification, and required protective ventilation with high PEEP (13 cm H2O, 6 ml kg−1 of ideal body weight) and high inspired oxygen fraction (100%). Despite early prone positioning, the patient developed refractory hypoxaemia and respiratory acidosis (pH 7.22) requiring veno-venous femoro-jugular ECMO and was transferred to our tertiary hospital centre. Chest CT confirmed pneumomediastinum and bilateral pneumothorax (Fig 1b). Fibreoptic bronchoscopy confirmed perforation of the cricoid membrane. Ventilation was possible without cutaneous emphysema or tidal volume loss.</text>

      <text>A 27-year-old woman at 30 and 3/7 weeks (gravida 2, para 1-0-0-1 [1 delivery, 0 premature delivery, 0 abortion, and 1 living child]) of pregnancy suffering respiratory distress was referred to our hospital from a maternity hospital due to fever, cough, and myalgia for 3 days. The patient had no underlying disease and declared no specific issue in her medication and family history (occupation: housekeeper). She noted no contact with anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 as well as no recent travel history (inside or outside of Iran) in the past two weeks. All the previous pregnancy scheduled screening tests had been performed to the date and all were normal. As mentioned in the maternity hospital summery sheet, early examinations showed respiratory rate (RR) = 34/min, heart rate (HR) = 110/min, body temperature (BT) = 39 °C, blood pressure (BP) = 100/60 mmHg, O2 saturation = 93%, and fetal heart rate (FHR) = 170/min. Also, it was noted on the summery sheet that patient had received oseltamivir, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone for less than 24 h. Also, results of vaginal examination and fern test stated to be normal by the maternity hospital. Due to tachypnea, she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and some laboratory tests were requested (Table 1 ). Also, a chest X-ray (Fig. 1 -A) was performed that showed faint bilateral patchy opacities. Considering the CXR findings, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and ceftazidime were started for the patient. Also, based on the CXR findings and after confirming with her gynecologist, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed (using abdominal shield) which revealed faint subpleural ground-glass opacities as well as pleural thickening (Fig. 1 -C). According to the published data to that date, the mentioned findings were not completely in concordance with COIVD-19. However, due to the abnormal imaging findings, the patient was transferred to our center. At the first moment of arrival, she seemed ill and toxic and her examinations showed RR = 37/min, HR = 130/min, the BT = 39.5 °C, BP = 135/85 mmHg, and O2 saturation = 92% (pulse oximetry). She was immediately transferred to the ICU and a full laboratory test was requested (Table 1) which most importantly showed leukopenia and thrombocytopenia accompanied with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Soon after, the fever increased up to 40 °C and RR to 55/min accompanied by suprasternal and intercostal retraction. Immediate blood tests showed metabolic alkalosis while the patient was under non-invasive ventilation. Finally, she was intubated and put under mechanical ventilation (Mode: SIMV(VC)+PSV, FiO2: 100%, rate 18/min, VT: 350 ml, and O2 saturation 85%). Following another portable CXR, infectious service consult, and suspicion of COVID-19, oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, meropenem, and vancomycin were started (azithromycin and ceftazidime were discontinued in our center). The bedside trans-thoracic echocardiography was ordered which results showed severe right ventricle and atrium enlargement, severe right side systolic dysfunction, and tricuspid valve regurgitation (systolic pulmonary artery pressure = 70 mmHg), with an ejection fraction (EF) ratio of 50% (other issues were not notable). Also, an hour after intubation, BP was decreased to (80/60 mmHg) for which, 5 mcg/kg/min of epinephrine drip was started until BP raised up to 100/60 mmHg. On the early morning next day, the nurses reported body movement under sedation and then following spontaneous contractions, a cyanotic fetus was delivered vaginally with Apgar score of 0 (first and 5th minute of the birth). This score did not change after neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Following NVD, O2 saturation was increased up to 90%; so, another CXR was requested that showed alveolar infiltration as bilateral patchy opacities (Fig. 1-B). Following the findings of the new CXR and since the clinical status of the patient was improved, another CT scan was requested for her which illustrated bilateral central consolidation and pleural effusion as new signs. Accordingly, possible ARDS or alveolar hemorrhages were suspected (Fig. 1 -D). However, regarding the nonspecific findings on the CT scan such as the presence of bilateral pleural effusion (Fig. 1 -D), increased Cr levels and proteinuria (Table 1), thrombocytopenia (Table 1), and evidence of alveolar hemorrhage (bloody mucosal secretions, one session, in the theracheal tube 12 h after intubation, probably due to either alveolar hemorrhage or intubation trauma accompanied with coagulation disorder), our internal medicine team suspected an acute collagen vascular autoimmune disease. Thus, the patient received corticosteroid pulse (methylprednisolone: 1gr) and a single session of emergent plasmapheresis with replacement of 2 L fresh frozen plasma. Following these actions, both neutrophil (count) and lymphocyte (count and ratio) were increased. Although, around afternoon, BP was decreased again and despite 40 mcg/kg/min epinephrine, the systolic pressure did not exceed 90–100 mmHg. After several hours, O2 saturation was decreased (70–75%) which, despite following all ARDS protocols, did not reach higher than 75% and unfortunately, the patient passed away due to multi-organ failure (ARDS, acute kidney injury, and septic shock).</text>

      <text>A 30-year-old man was transferred to our ED from an outside hospital for neurologic consultation on March 11, 2020. The patient had presented with dysarthria, right hemiparesis, and a right facial droop. A non-contrast head CT performed at the outside hospital showed a 1.7-cm acute left basal ganglia hemorrhage (Fig. 3a). The patient was admitted to the Stroke Service who managed the patient by obtaining a CT angiogram of the head and neck. There was no vascular malformation or other etiology for the hemorrhage, but there were sub-centimeter ill-defined nodules in both upper lobes of the lung and a 1.8-cm nodule at the periphery of the left upper lobe (Fig. 3 b and c), and COVID-19 was suggested by the interpreting neuroradiologist.</text>

      <text>We report on a 59-year-old woman 13 months after bilateral lung transplantation who presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection. She underwent bilateral lung transplantation because of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in February 2019. Alemtuzumab was administered as induction therapy, and a dual immunosuppressive regimen consisting of tacrolimus and prednisolone was used as maintenance therapy. Following a complicated post-transplant course, she was discharged 3 months post-operatively. The highest forced expiratory volume at 1 second value was reached in December 2019 with 1.60 liters (72% predicted). On the day of hospitalization (Day 0), she presented to the outpatient clinic for a routine follow-up visit with no apparent symptoms. Lung function testing showed a drop in forced expiratory volume at 1 second to 1.28 liters (57% predicted). Upon questioning, she expressed mild exercise dyspnea and a dry cough but no fever or diarrhea. The patient had no concerning travel history. Immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus 0.6 mg twice daily (trough level was 5–7 ng/dl owing to alemtuzumab induction and history of osteomyelitis), and 5 mg prednisolone daily. Leukocyte count was 11,360 cells/μl (6% lymphocytes), C-reactive protein was 1.0 mg/dl, lactate dehydrogenase was 297 units/liter, and creatine kinase was 32 units/liter. There was no thrombocytopenia. Arterial blood had a partial pressure of oxygen of 55 mm Hg without supplementation. Real-time reverse transcriptase–PCR (RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0 from Altona Diagnostics) of nasal and pharyngeal swabs showed evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, thereby establishing a diagnosis of COVID-19. She was hospitalized, and a chest X-ray showed chronic post-operative dystelectasis on the left side with some increase in density (Figure 1 ) compared with December 2019. A chest computerized tomography scan showed ground glass opacities mainly in the left lower lobe with left-sided parenchymal consolidation or partial atelectasis (Figure 2 ). Oxygen supplementation with 1 to 2 liters/minute was administered. Antibacterial therapy was empirically started based on suspected bacterial superinfection. Otherwise, no major changes in medication were performed. A detailed medication plan is shown in Table 1 . She remained asymptomatic and remained stable. RT-PCR testing was performed on a weekly basis and remained positive on Day 7 and Day 14. Cycle threshold levels of SARS-CoV-2 E- and S-gene are provided in Table 2 . Cycle threshold values increased at every sample time point, indicating a decrease in virus levels over time. On nasopharyngeal swabs on Day 21, no SARS-CoV-2-RNA could be detected by RT-PCR. No oxygen was required from Day 17 until discharge. The patient was discharged home on Day 21.</text>

      <text>The first was a 51-year-old man with a heart transplant on November 8th, 2003. His immunosuppression was tacrolimus 1 mg twice daily plus mycophenolate mofetil 0.5 g twice daily. The last known blood concentration of tacrolimus was 6.5 ng/ml, and cardiac allograft function was normal with a history of well controlled hypertension. On Jan 23rd 2020, he complained of intermittent fever, chills, fatigue, poor appetite and diarrhea. On examination, his temperature was 38.5°C, oxygen saturation was 99% on room air, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute without distress. Laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count of 4.87 × 109 /L (normal range, 4.0–10.0 × 109 /L), C Reactive Protein of 18.6 mg/L (normal range, 0-10 mg/L). Chest computed tomographic (CT) scan showed bilateral ground-glass opacities (Figure 1 ). He was initially treated with intravenous levofloxacin and ribavirin, but remained febrile. He was admitted to Wuhan Fifth Hospital on Jan 26th 2020 and a throat swab nucleic acid test was positive for 2019-nCoV. Moxifloxacin 0.4 g and ganciclovir 0.25 g were then given intravenously daily (and continued until Feb 5th 2020). Initially, his temperature rose to 39°C with a dry cough on Jan 27th,2020 and oxygen saturation decreased gradually requiring oxygen nasal supplementation. Body temperature dropped to normal on Jan 29th, however oxygen saturation deteriorated, (75% without supplemental oxygen after slight activity). CT scan revealed worsening of lung lesions (Figure 1) and oxygen was given through a face mask with improvement of oxygen saturation to 95%. Intravenous human gamma globulin 10 g / day plus methylprednisolone 80 mg/day for initiated for 5 consecutive days and other immunosuppressive drugs were held from Jan 30th to Feb 5th, 2020. After treatment, the patient's symptoms improved, and oxygen saturation maintained above 96% with nasal cannula oxygen. Intravenous medications were then stopped, and oral administration of moxifloxacin 0.4 g/day and arbidol (a non-nucleoside antiviral and immunomodulating drug given for influenza), at a dose of 0.2 g three times a day was administered for 5 days. Immunosuppressive and antihypertensive drugs were resumed on Feb 12th, 2020. The patient's temperature normalized for more than 20 days, without cough for 10 days and preserved oxygen saturation. Two consecutive RT-PCR throat swabs for 2019-nCoV on Feb 14th and 18th 2020, were negative. CT scan on Feb 24th showed significant resolution of lung lesions (Figure 1). The patient was discharged on Feb 27th 2020. Typical imaging demonstrated dynamic progress of the disease (Figure 1). However, resolution of lung lesions lagged behind symptoms relief.</text>

      <text>To date, several studies and a few case reports have explored chest CT signs of COVID-19 in children and newborns. The CT manifestations of COVID-19 in pediatric patients are diverse and lack specificity. Some mild pediatric patients with COVID-19 show normal findings on chest CT. In those patients presenting lung abnormality, ground glass opacity (GGO) mainly in the peripheral and posterior lungs that did not spare the subpleural regions is the most frequently observed performance. Compared with adults, GGO in pediatric patients with COVID-19 has the characteristics of more localized extent, lower attenuation, and less lobular involvement (Fig. 1). Feng K et al reported that small nodular GGO may be a suggestive appearance of pediatric patients with epidemiology. Moreover, other manifestations such as consolidation, GGO with consolidation, or interlobular septa thickening can also be observed in the pediatric patients. We summarized the chest CT imaging characteristics of pediatric patients that have been reported so far in Table 3. Although milder patients are more common in children, a few of them may turn into disease progression. In these patients, GGO may develop into multiple consolidation with the extent of GGO enlarged and attenuation of GGO increased. Moreover, the lung interstitial changes may become more obvious than before. In very rare cases, diffuse lung consolidation occurs, presenting “white lung”. In resolving stage, lung lesions will be completely resolved or only remain minimal linear opacities. In addition to the CT findings mentioned above, it is worth noting that in some cases the high spatial resolution CT changes are similar to those of bronchopneumonia, manifesting as a patchy opacity along the bronchial vascular bundle. Meanwhile, one of these cases presenting as bronchopneumonia complicate with mycoplasma infection. As Xia et al reported, underlying co-infection is very common in pediatric patients (9 of 20, 45%), which means that case exclusion should be more carefully done while pediatric patients have definite epidemiological history but atypical CT findings. Pleural effusion was reported in several pediatric patients. No cases reported lymphadenopathy.</text>

      <text>Chest CT scans and X-ray images are shown in Fig. 2. All patients had bilateral pneumonia with ground-glass opacity (GGO), with or without initial consolidations. More prominent consolidation appeared over time, especially in radiography taken before death. For instance, in Case 3, chest X-ray revealed patchy high-density opacity in both lungs, which was more prominent in the lower lobes (Fig. 2 C1). This worsened during the last few days before death (Fig. 2 C2).</text>

      <text>This template stratifies patients into one of four groups based on CXR findings: classic/probable COVID-19 findings (Fig 1 ); indeterminate for COVID-19 (Fig 2 ); normal (COVID-19 not excluded in the correct clinical context); and features most consistent with a non-COVID-19 diagnosis (Fig 3 ). Frontline doctors have found this a useful adjunct to clinical assessment, particularly when CXRs are “hot-reported”. More nuanced severity grades can also be applied, in particular for the classic/probable COVID-19 CXRs: these include a simple qualitative scoring method (mild, moderate, severe) or the quantitative modified Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) scoring system. </text>

      <text> 8 patients with the mean age of 49.71 ± 13.13 (range: 34 – 67) years were studied (62.5% male). The trauma mechanism was fall from height in 5 (62.5%) and car accident in 3 (37.5%) cases. None of the patients had symptoms in favor of COVID-19 infection such as fever, dyspnea, headache, cough, etc. at the time of admission. 5 (62.5%) patient had history of close contact with a suspected COVID-19 case. Physical examinations of lungs revealed no signs of pneumonia. A chest CT scan without contrast was performed to evaluate high-energy trauma and the findings strongly were in favor of pneumonia. The results of RT-PCR was positive for COVID-19 infection in all patients. During the hospital stay, two patients (25%) experienced mild symptoms such as fever, cough, and myalgia and the rest stayed asymptomatic. In the laboratory results, 4 (50%) patients had a slight increase in C - reactive protein (Maximum 18) and the rest of the laboratory findings were normal. Two patients underwent orthopedic surgery without any respiratory complication. All patients received standard treatment (Hydroxychloroquine with or without Azithromycin). None of the patients required intensive care. All patients were discharged from hospital after completion of treatment and had no mortality. Figure 1 shows axial cuts of the cases’ chest CT scan.</text>

      <text>For extraction of radiological semantic features, two senior radiologists (D.L. and X.C., more than 15 years of experience) reached a consensus, blinded to clinical and laboratory findings. The radiological semantic features included both qualitative and quantitative imaging features. The lesions in the outer third of the lung were defined as peripheral, and lesions in the inner two-thirds of the lung were defined as central. The progression of COVID-19 lesions within each lung lobe was evaluated by scoring each lobe from 0 to 4, corresponding to normal, 1~25% infection, 26~50% infection, 51~75% infection, and more than 75% infection, respectively. The scores were combined for all five lobes to provide a total score ranging from 0 to 20. A total of 41 radiological features (26 quantitative and 15 qualitative) were extracted for the analysis. The descriptions of radiological semantic features are listed in the Supplementary Material (Table E2). Figure 1 is one example of the evaluation of CT imaging.</text>

      <text>Laboratory tests of children and adults were analyzed. The results showed that the white blood cell counts of children were all normal, with decreased neutrophil counts (p = 0.00) and increased lymphocyte counts (p = 0.00) compared with adults (Table 2). Considering the physical characteristics of the children with lymphocytes making up 60% of the white blood cells before 6 years and the proportions of lymphocytes and neutrophils in white blood cells being close to that of adults after 6 years, we further analyzed the difference in blood cell counts between children over 6 years and adults. There are 5 cases over 6 years (35.7%) among 14 children cases, the neutrophil counts (1.62 ± 0.34 × 109/L) were more decreased in children over 6 years than in adults (p = 0.02). however, lymphocyte counts (1.91 ± 0.93 × 109/L) showed no difference (p = 0.41) between the two groups. COVID-19 caused liver function damage, cardiac muscle damage, and coagulation function changes. The abnormal rate of ALT, AST, LDH, CK, Myo, PT, and D-dimer was 17%, 7.5%, 18.9%, 15.1%, 3.8%, 13.2%, and 35.8% in adults and 7.7%, 7.7%, 50%, 28.6%, 0%, 7.1%, and 35.7% in children, respectively (Table 2). The value and positive rate of LDH in children were more significantly increased than in adults (p = 0.01; p = 0.02) (Table 2). According to evaluation of infection indicators, the value of PCT showed no difference between children and adults, However, the value and positive rate of CRP were more significantly increased in adults than in children (p = 0.00, p = 0.02) (Table 2). Of the 67 cases, 56 cases had complications of lung injuries (83.6%) including 11 children and 45 adults. A total of 6 children (64.5%) and 30 adults (66.7%) had lung injuries with bilateral involvement, with no difference between the two groups (p = 0.45). However, lung injuries in adults were more severe compared with that in children (Table 2, Fig. 1).</text>

      <text>Previous reports indicated that decreased lymphocytes counts were common clinical features, especially in severe cases. As a result of viral infection, white blood cell and lymphocyte counts can be reduced by consumption. However, similar results did not appear in our study, with only a total of 6 cases including 1 case of a child with decreased lymphocytes counts, and the value of lymphocytes counts showed no significant differences in children over 6 years compared with adults. On the other hand, neutrophil counts decreased in children compared with adults (p = 0.02). So, lymphocyte decline is not an important indicator for the diagnosis of childhood cases and the neutrophil count decline should be focused on. These may be due to a lower inflammatory response in children. SARS-CoV-2 infection may induced lung injuries, liver function damage, cardiac muscle damage, kidney damage, and coagulation function changes. Among these laboratory tests, elevated LDH is more common in children than in adults (p = 0.02). An elevated LDH is commonly seen in cardiopulmonary disease and inflammation. The elevated LDH suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be more likely to cause cardiopulmonary injury and inflammation in children, although lung inflammation in children is less severe than in adults. Of course, since the level of LDH is not high in children, it may not have practical clinical significance. Both CRP and IL-6 are major indicators of inflammation. An elevated level of CRP and IL-6 was shown in adults, but not in children, which suggests that inflammation caused by viral infection, especially in the lungs, is less severe in children than in adults. In addition, lung injuries are not uncommon in children and are characterized by bilateral involvement, which is similar to that of adults. However, lung injuries in adults were more severe compared with children (Fig. 1). Of the 14 children cases, 8 cases were asymptomatic cases. The age of asymptomatic patients was younger than that of symptomatic patients. The white blood cell and lymphocyte counts were more decreased in symptomatic children cases than that in asymptomatic children cases, which was due to a lower inflammatory response in asymptomatic children cases. Even among asymptomatic patients, 62.5% of cases had lung injuries. Therefore, lung injuries caused by SARS-CoV-2 is still relatively obvious. The CT findings may further provide the reason why elevated levels of CRP were shown in adults, but not in children and elevated levels of LDH are common in children. The spike-protein (S) of SARS-CoV that mediates entrance to human respiratory epithelial cells by interacting with cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the most important means of pathogenesis. The number of ACE2 receptors are significantly lower in children than in adults and more in the lungs than in other organs, which may be the primary reason why children have fewer clinical symptoms and organ dysfunction than adults and lung injuries even among asymptomatic children cases. In addition, the weak immune response triggered by viral infection because of children’s weakened immune function maybe responsible for this state.</text>

      <text>On Jan 22, 2020, she travelled from Wuhan to Guangzhou, China by high speed rail. From Feb 11, she developed fever lasted for 9 days, and developed cough as well as sore throat, without chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia. On Feb 20, she was transferred to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University with a body temperature of 38 °C. The next day, she developed a bit shortness of breath, with a body temperature of 37.5 °C. On Feb 21, blood routine tests showed normal white blood cell counts, but decreased lymphocyte counts. The blood glucose was increased. Chest CT scans showed bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities and consolidation (Fig. 1 ). Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected twice and both were negative for SARS-CoV-2 tested by qRT-PCR. However, sputum samples collected on the same day were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by NGS. Furthermore, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were also found in the sputum samples by NGS. In the afternoon of the same day, the oxygen saturation values of the patient decreased to 91.2%, and the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood decreased to 61.2 mmHg. Therefore, she received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (40% concentration, flow rate 60 L/min). The patient was diagnosed as severe COVID-19, and was transferred to the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University for isolation and treatment where are designed to treat severe COVID-19 cases by local health authorities.</text>

      <text>On February 4, 2020, a 50-year-old female patient, who is a businesswoman, presented with chief complaints of “fever for one week, diarrhea, anorexia, and asthenia,” and she was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Fever Clinic of Xiangyang First People’s Hospital Affiliated to Hubei Medical College. The patient had a five-day business trip in Wuhan (from January 22, 2020, to January 27, 2020). Fever initially occurred on January 28, 2020, with a body temperature of 38.5°C, with dry cough and muscle ache. On January 30, 2020, the patient went to Xiangyang First People’s Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for consultation in the respiratory department, and the laboratory test reported that the influenza A virus serology was negative. The results of blood routine examination were normal [white blood cell count (WBC): 5.1×109/l; neutrophil percentage (neu%): 69.2%; lymphocyte percentage (lym%): 25.6%; lymphocyte absolute value (lym): 1.28×109/l; C-reactive protein (CRP): 6.1 mg/l] and she was given Tamiflu (75 mg/time, twice per day) orally and was rehydrated. Three days later (on February 2, 2020), the patient still had dry cough, so she went to hospital (TCM) again. It was noted that before the onset of the disease, the patient went to Wuhan on a business trip and a novel coronavirus nucleic acid test was performed and it was negative. At admission, chest X-ray showed increased and thickened right lower lung markings, which suggested bronchitis and possible interstitial pneumonia according to her positive family history of interstitial pneumonia (Figure 1). Levofloxacin was given drip once for intravenous treatment, and Tamiflu was continued to be taken orally. On February 04, 2020, the patient's symptoms were still not improved, and her body temperature continued to rise to 39.2°C. She was referred to our fever clinic for further evaluation, and a chest computed tomography (CT) was performed. Chest CT showed bilateral multifocal ground glass opacities with consolidation which suggested viral pneumonia as a differential diagnosis (Figure 2a, 2b), and the subsequent 2019-nCoV pneumonia nucleic acid test was positive.</text>

      <text>During the course of treatment, the patient had no respiratory distress symptoms except for persistent fever and cough. Based on the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan in China (trial version fifth), alpha interferon aerosol inhalation (dose for adults: five million U; add sterile water for injection, 2 mL, twice daily) with oral abidol (200 mg for adults, three times a day) was used in this patient. Five days after the initiation of the treatment (February 10, 2020), the patient has recovered completely, the nucleic acid retest was negative, and chest CT findings resolved (Figure 2c). After 14 days of isolation in the hotel designated by the hospital, the patient was discharged. The follow-up results (as of February 25, 2020) showed no abnormality, and the nucleic acid retesting was still negative. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.</text>

      <text>To the best of our knowledge, we present here the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in a patient on left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. Our case patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy, on HeartMate II (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) LVAD as destination therapy, hypertension, atrial flutter and ischemic stroke who presented with a four-day history of fever, cough and shortness of breath following recent two-month travel to Egypt. Initial physical examination revealed a body temperature of 100.9 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 degrees Celsius), normal mean arterial pressure by Doppler, and oxygen saturation of 70% on room air. Arterial blood gas revealed a PaO2 of 46 mmHg despite delivery of 100% FiO2 via non-rebreather ventilation. LVAD parameters were stable on presentation. A chest radiograph showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of multifocal pneumonia (Figure 1 a). The patient appeared to be in moderate respiratory distress, with tachypnea and accessory muscle use. Due to concern for developing respiratory muscle fatigue and impending respiratory failure, the decision was made to pursue intubation and mechanical ventilation.</text>

      <text>We present the case of a 79-year-old man with a history of fever and cough of 3 days' duration referred to the emergency department with acute loss of consciousness. At admission he was febrile (temperature 38.6°C), with a fast heart rate (115 beats per minute) and rapid breathing (respiratory rate, 22 breaths per minute). Blood pressure was 140/65 mm Hg. Partial pressure of oxygen was 51.8 mm Hg; partial pressure of carbon dioxide was 27.9 mm Hg; and saturated oxygen was 86.6%. There was no history of hypertension or anticoagulation therapy. In addition to loss of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale score = 7) and bilateral extensor plantar reflexes, physical examination revealed coarse rales in the left lower lobe of the lungs. Paraclinical findings revealed lymphopenia (590 cells/mm2), erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 85 mm/h, C-reactive protein of 10 mg/L, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, platelets of 210 × 109/L, prothrombin time of 12 seconds, international normalized ratio of 1 and partial thromboplastin time of 64 seconds, as well as normal liver function and other routine laboratory tests. Lung computed tomography revealed a ground-glass opacity in the left lower lobe, and brain computed tomography revealed a massive intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) in the right hemisphere, accompanied by intraventricular and subarachnoid haemorrhage (Fig. 1). Real-time PCR of oropharyngeal swab confirmed COVID-19 infection.</text>

      <text>A-lines are a form of reverberation artifact caused by reflections of the pleura. These are seen as parallel lines to the sliding pleura which are equally spaced and descend towards the bottom of the screen (Fig. 4 ).   A-lines can help to indicate normal aerated lung     however may also be present in a pneumothorax, so careful interrogation of the pleural line for both visual sliding and employing the use of M-mode to look for the seashore sign is essential to help exclude a pneumothorax.</text>

The result of a rapid influenza test was negative. The electrocardiogram was unremarkable (Figure 1 ). Computed tomography of the chest revealed bilateral interstitial densities consistent with an infectious or inflammatory process and no evidence of pulmonary embolism (Figure 2A ). She was started on intravenous fluids, a prophylactic dose of enoxaparin, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and cefepime because of a high suspicion for pneumonia. She was also tested for COVID-19.</text>

Her symptoms improved with supportive measures, antibiotics were discontinued, and a plan was made to discharge her home to self-quarantine. However, before discharge she developed sudden severe dyspnea while walking in her room. She was noted to be hypoxic, with her Sao 2 dropping to 83%, with a resultant oxygen requirement of 6 liters by nasal cannula. Repeat computed tomography of the chest revealed large bilateral central and proximal segmental pulmonary artery emboli and a linear saddle pulmonary embolus (Figure 2B). Bedside transthoracic echocardiography revealed right ventricular dilatation with reduced function associated with severe tricuspid regurgitation (Figures 3A and 3B ).</text>

      <text>Typical features on chest CT include ground-glass opacity with a cloud-like change on chest CT, not obscuring the accompanying pulmonary vascular structures in lungs. Corresponding pathological changes are exudation in the alveolar cavity with partial filling of the air cavity, mainly from serous and fibrinous exudates, alveolar septal vascular congestion and edema. Disease progression mostly occurs in a course of 7-10 days, with enlarged and increased density of GGO, and consolidated lesions with air bronchogram sign. GGOs from the early stage expand, and the density increases gradually. Consolidation shows increased lung parenchymal density, and blurred borders of the pulmonary blood vessels and airway walls due to the loss of air contrast. The lesion range can be acinar, leaflet, lung segment or lung lobe. Lesions are distributed as bilateral asymmetrical subpleural wedge-shaped or fan-shaped, mostly in the caudal regions of the lung and dorsal subpleural area. When interlobular septa and intralobular interstitium are thickened, this is displayed as subpleural reticulation according to a "crazy paving" pattern. The underlying pathological changes are pulmonary edema, protein exudation, thickening of intralobular interstitial, and multinucleated giant cells and macrophage infiltration in the alveolar cavity. Critical stage disease may show further expansion of consolidations, with the whole lung showing increased opacity, a so-called "white lung". In recovery stage patients, the lesion area is reduced and absorbed, or only residual fibrous lesions are seen. Less common findings include pleural effusion, stretch bronchiectasis, and thoracic lymphadenopathy (Imaging examples are shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 ).</text>

      <text>However, the patient’s state became continuously aggravated despite active treatments. 12 days after admission, the patient was supplied with invasive ventilator assisted ventilation because of respiratory failure. Bedside chest radiograph displayed progress of bilateral interstitial infiltrating shadows (Fig. 1b). WBC was slightly reduced to 7.71 × 109/L, with NE% 94.3%, LY% 1.7%. The CREA was 190.1 µmol/L, BUN 36.87 mmol/L, ALT 56 U/L, AST 85 U/L, CRP 254.55 mg/L, PCT 2.77 ng/mL. The BNP was reduce to 185.7 pg/mL, cTnI to 64.3 ng/L, CKMB to 44 U/L; but the Myo was &gt; 1200 ng/mL. And CK was still high with 2000 U/L and Creatine kinase–MB. Coagulation function was still not improved with D-dimer &gt; 8 ug/mL. 14 days after admission, the patient eventually died because of respiratory and circulatory failure. Final diagnosis was COVID-19 (very severe), venous thrombosis and arteriosclerosis obliterans of lower extremity, rhabdomyolysis, renal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, atrial fibrillation and type 2 diabetes.</text>

      <text>The patient was a 74-year-old man with a body weight of 65 kg and had no overseas travel history and no contact with COVID-19 patients. He was a hepatitis B carrier and had hypertension, bronchial asthma, and was not under a medical treatment. He experienced slight fever on Day 1 and was admitted to a nearby hospital on Day 4 with prolonged high fever (&gt; 39 °C) and shortness of breath. The Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test revealed poorly controlled diabetes with a value of 9.4%. The PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was positive, and he was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Day 7. He received intensive drug treatment, including ciclesonide, lopinavir/ritonavir and systemic corticosteroids, as well as respiratory care. Despite these treatments, his respiratory condition deteriorated, and he underwent tracheal intubation (23 cm deep from the mouth) for mechanical ventilation on Day 11. After his transfer to our hospital on Day 12, favipiravir was added to the drug regimen to improve the general condition. However, the patient's condition did not improve despite these intensive treatments. Because of the prolonged tracheal intubation, a tracheostomy was performed after consultation with the anesthesiologists, medical staff in the intensive care unit (ICU), and the infection prevention and control team. Surgical tracheostomy was performed on Day 28 in a negative-pressure airborne infection isolation room in our ICU. Fig. 1 shows the patient's clinical course and chest radiological findings before tracheostomy was performed. After the tracheostomy, his respiratory condition improved by Day 35, and thus he was considered for transfer to the other hospital.</text>

      <text>Initial and serial laboratory results are shown in Table 1 . A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed diffuse infiltrate and ground-glass opacities bilaterally with no pleural effusion (Fig. 2 ). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, size, and no abnormality of its valve. A rapid influenza test with a nasal swab taken on the day of admission was negative, and the gram-stain of his sputum specimen was insignificant. Both pneumococcal and legionella urinary antigen tests were negative, as was a loop-mediated isothermal amplification test for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores on hospital day 1 were 4 and 13, respectively.</text>

      <text>Since surgical tracheostomy under mechanical ventilation pose greater risks of droplet and aerosol exposure for operators, the procedure was performed under neuromuscular blockade and the patient was temporarily removed from the ventilator to prevent the generation of droplets and airborne particles. After surgical tracheostomy on the 6th day of hospitalization, improvement in lung compliance was observed, and tapering of sweep gas flow was started from the 9th day (ECMO day 8). On hospital day 12 (ECMO day 11), decannulation and removal of VV-ECMO was successfully performed, and he was freed from mechanical ventilation and oxygen on hospital days 14 and 18, respectively. His total intensive care unit stay was 15 days, and PCR tests performed on hospital days 13 and 15 were both negative. Serial chest X-rays and his clinical course in the intensive care unit are shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4 , respectively. He was discharged to home on hospital day 24. We did not experience any nosocomial spread or infection to medical staff after caring the patient.</text>

The lowest values of lymphocyte, CD3+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell, and B-cell were 76, 9, 6, 9 and 2, respectively. Meanwhile, the levels of T lymphocyte subsets varied according to different severity of illness (Table1-2 and Figure 2 ). 62 patients assessed T lymphocyte subsets more than once, including mild-ill (n=18), severe-ill (n=22) and critically-ill (n=22). After 5-14 days in-hospital treatment, the counts of T lymphocyte subsets slightly increased than disease onset (Figure 2A). Meanwhile, we presented CT scan images and temporal changes of T lymphocyte subsets, SAA and CRP of 4 critically-ill patients which have results more than once in Figure 3 (Detail information in Table 2 ).</text>

      <text>In December 2019, an acute febrile illness with severe respiratory distress syndrome started to occur in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. 1 ,  2 ,  3  Most patients developed patchy to diffuse infiltration of the lungs radiographically 2  (Figure 1). It was found that most early cases were linked to a local fresh seafood market, the Huanan Seafood Market, although some—particularly later cases—were not. 2  Initial investigations identified a novel bat coronavirus as a possible culprit, which was subsequently confirmed by detection of viral sequences by multiple teams independently, and by virus isolation from the lower respiratory tracts of patients. 3 ,  5  The novel virus has been named novel coronavirus (nCoV)‐2019. Genomic sequences of viruses from five cases are shown to be almost identical to one another, with the homology of 79.5% to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)‐CoV and 85% to 96% to a bat SARS‐like coronavirus (bat‐SL‐CoVZC45) at the whole genome level. 4  The outbreak thus represents a newly emerging viral disease due to species jumping of a virus to humans.</text>

      <text>Clinically, patients with novel coronaviral pneumonia are characterized by fever with or without chills, dry cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. 1 ,  2 ,  3  Chest computerized tomography (CT) scan shows patchy to diffuse interstitial infiltrates or thickening (Figure 1), some with the characteristic ground‐glass‐like density. Very severe cases can develop radiographic changes of the so‐called “white lungs.” Laboratory tests show lowered lymphocytes and white blood cell counts in most patients, among other abnormalities. 2  The China National Health Commission communicated guidelines 6  for initial diagnosis and disease severity triage into common (mild), severe, and critical categories. Diagnosis is based on epidemic exposure, plus two of the following clinical findings: fever, radiographic features as described above, normal or lowered white blood cells, or reduced lymphocyte count.</text>

      <text>Our patient is a 77-year-old retired physician who was reported to be otherwise healthy except for a known hypertension. He experienced a fall at home and presented to a local emergency room with a questionable loss of consciousness and fever. Because of the high rate of community acquired infections in the area of the local emergency room, a complete COVID-2019 workup that included a Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the chest was obtained. The CT scan demonstrated characteristic ground glass opacities which have been associated with COVID-2019. Additionally, there was concern of an intramural hematoma and an acute ascending aortic dissection could not be ruled out. He was transferred to our institution for further management. Due to the concerning CT report and lack of availability of the images, the CT scan was repeated with specific heart-rate gating and contrast bolus administration focusing on his aortic pathology. Again, an ascending aortic hematoma was visualized, and a Type A aortic dissection could not be ruled out (Fig. 1). Given the findings of pulmonary infiltrates, upon admission, he was placed in strict droplet and contact precautions in a negative air-flow Intensive Care Unit (ICU) room as a potential COVID-2019 case. Testing had been obtained prior to transfer. Given his presentation and presumed acute aortic syndrome, and after a multi-disciplinary discussion and shared decision making of the risks and benefits with the patient and his son, it was determined that he should undergo emergent cardiac surgical intervention. Again, because of the risk of exposure, a confirmatory transesophageal echocardiogram was deferred until he was in the operating room. Because of his presumed COVID-2019 infection, we established the following protocol to limit potential HCF spread: </text>

      <text>A 4‐year‐old male was admitted to the hospital with the main complaint of “cough and runny nose for 3 days.” 1  The patient had good spirits, normal temperature, no wheezing, dyspnea, and so forth. Before admission, the child had contact with his grandfather and grandmother who had returned from the epidemic area of Wuhan, and both of them and the child's parents were diagnosed with COVID‐2019. Laboratory examination results showed white blood cells (WBC): 5.87 × 109/L, neutrophil: 32.8%, lymphogranulocyte: 53.4%, monocyte: 12.7%, neutrophil: 1.93 × 109/L, lymphocyte: 3.13 × 109/L, and C‐reactive protein (CRP): 11.2 mg/L; blood biochemistry results showed a total protein: 70 g/L, albumin: 42.1 g/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 10 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 31 U/L, total bilirubin: 4.3 µmol/L, direct bilirubin: 0.8 µmol/L, indirect bilirubin: 31 µmol/L, total bile acid: 8.6 µmol/L, urea: 4.6 mmol/L, creatinine: 34 µmol/L, and uric acid: 212 µmol/L; and there were no obvious abnormalities in six blood coagulation parameters or the myocardial enzyme range. A chest computed tomography (CT) showed spots in the two upper lobes, right lower lobes, and left lower lobes that were considered to result from an infectious disease. Real‐time fluorescence reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) detection of SARSCoV‐2 nucleic acid in respiratory tract samples of the child was positive. He is still under active treatment and has not been discharged (Figure 1).</text>

      <text>Additionally, a 4‐year‐old female was admitted to the hospital with the main complaint of “10 days of contact with a confirmed case of COVID‐2019.” The girl is the cousin of the abovementioned child with the same epidemiological history, and the girl's grandparents and parents have a confirmed diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia, all of which are thus in the hospital for treatment. The laboratory examination results showed WBC: 6.68 × 109/L, neutrophil: 49.5%, lymphogranulocyte: 42.3%, monocyte: 6.3%, neutrophil: 3.31 × 109/L, lymphocyte: 2.63 × 109/L, and CRP: 0.56 mg/L; blood biochemistry results showed total protein: 64.3 g/L, albumin: 42.0 g/L, ALT: 13 U/L, AST: 27 U/L, total bilirubin: 4.6 µmol/L, direct bilirubin: 0.7 µmol/L, indirect bilirubin: 3.9 µmol/L, total bile acid: 5.4 µmol/L, urea: 4.6 mmol/L, creatinine: 35 µmol/L, and uric acid: 318 µmol/L; and there were no obvious abnormalities in six blood coagulation parameters or the myocardial enzyme range. A chest CT showed increased and slightly disordered bronchovascular bundles on both sides (Figure 2). Real‐time fluorescence RT‐PCR detection of SARSCoV‐2 nucleic acid in respiratory tract samples was initially negative but positive after 1 day, 2  but the signs were still mild. After admission, supportive treatment and oxygen therapy were strengthened. At present, the patient's vital signs are stable. She is still under active treatment and has not been discharged.

      <text>A 74-year-old male with past medical history of atrial fibrillation, cardioembolic stroke, parkinson disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent cellulitis presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of fever and cough. The patient had a full workup, including routine labs and chest x-ray, which were nonrevealing. The patient was discharged home under the suspicion that this was an exacerbation of his COPD. The patient went home on oral antibiotics. The patient returned to the emergency room (ER) within 24 hours with worsening symptoms, including headache, altered mental status, fever, and cough. The patient is originally from the Netherlands and presented to our hospital seven days after arriving to the United States. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further workup. All protective measures and precautions for suspected COVID-19 infection were taken. The patient was placed in isolation. Repeat chest x-ray demonstrated small right pleural effusion with bilateral ground glass opacities (see Figure 1). CT chest revealed patchy bibasilar consolidations and subpleural opacities. Both throat sputum and nasopharyngeal cultures were negative for strep. Blood cultures were negative, and urine analysis was negative. Influenza A and B tests were negative.</text>

      <text>In the early phase of the disease, CT typically shows bilateral ground glass opacities, with a predominantly peripheral, subpleural location. These opacities can be quite extensive in the sub-pleural areas (Figs. 1a, c, 2a and 3) or may be more focal, with a rounded shape (Fig 2b). Intralobular reticulations can be seen superimposed on the ground glass opacities, resulting in a crazy-paving pattern (Fig. 2e) which is usually associated with a more severe stage of the disease. Patients evaluated several days after the beginning of symptoms can present with linear consolidation (Figs. 1b, d and 2d) or areas with reverse halo appearances, both suggesting organizing pneumonia, which is a common reaction to lung injury. Extensive consolidation is associated with a poorer prognosis in older patients (Fig 4c).</text>

      <text>In the early phase of the disease, CT typically shows bilateral ground glass opacities, with a predominantly peripheral, subpleural location. These opacities can be quite extensive in the sub-pleural areas (Figs. 1a, c, 2a and 3) or may be more focal, with a rounded shape (Fig 2b). Intralobular reticulations can be seen superimposed on the ground glass opacities, resulting in a crazy-paving pattern (Fig. 2e) which is usually associated with a more severe stage of the disease. Patients evaluated several days after the beginning of symptoms can present with linear consolidation (Figs. 1b, d and 2d) or areas with reverse halo appearances, both suggesting organizing pneumonia, which is a common reaction to lung injury. Extensive consolidation is associated with a poorer prognosis in older patients (Fig 4c).</text>

      <text>Of all 150 COVID-19 pneumonia patients in this study, their pulmonary lesions had 3 main morphologies, including 18 cases (12.00%) of ground-glass nodules &lt; 10 mm (Fig. 1a), 124 cases (82.67%) of patchy GGO with or without consolidation (Fig. 1b), and 8 cases (5.33%) of cord-like lesions (Fig. 1c). Some patients had multiple imaging manifestations. There were 12 patients (8.00%) who also had thickening of the bronchovascular bundles in the lesions (Fig. 1d), 53 patients (35.33%) with adjacent pleural thickening and interlobular septum thickening presenting as the crazy-paving sign (Fig. 1e), and 54 patients (36.00%) whose CT images showed the air bronchogram sign (Fig. 1f). In addition, 6 cases (4.00%) exhibited pleural effusion, and 2 cases (1.33%) exhibited enlarged lymph nodes.</text>

      <text>CT images were evaluated for distribution, lobe predomination (superior lobe, inferior lobe, middle lobe, and balanced predomination), lesion number, lesion attenuation (GGO, consolidation, and GGO with consolidation), lesion margin (clear, vague), and GGO lesion involvement pattern.

GGO was defined as a hazy increase in lung attenuation with no obscuration of the underlying vessels. GGO lesion involvement pattern was defined as patchy GGO, cluster-like GGO, combination of GGO and consolidation opacities, whole consolidation, which represented the lesion attenuation and involvement regions (Fig. 2). The other parameters were lesion contour (shrinking, non-shrinking, Fig. 3), bronchial wall thickening (Fig. 4), air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, interlobular septal thickening, intralobular septal thickening, and pleural effusion.</text>

      <text>As shown in Table 3 , the progression assessments along with time course were analyzed, 64 (67.4%) patients showed improvements on CT scan (Fig. 2 a and b), 15 (15.8%) showed worsening manifestation (Fig. 2c and d) and 16 (16.8%) present as stable. Compared with worsening group, we found that patients tended to have younger age in improving/stable group (45.3 ± 15.0 VS. 59.3 ± 13.5, P = 0.001). There was no significant difference between worsening group and improving/stable group regarding all the characteristics shown on the first CT scan (Table 3).</text>

      <text>A 63-year-old woman with metastatic ovarian cancer and recurrent malignant pleural effusion came to our institutional ER with fever (39 °C) and dyspnea at rest. Being our institute located in a severely involved area of the COVID-19 outbreak, clinical symptoms were compatible with COVID-19 infection. Laboratory parameters included hemoglobin 10.7, white blood cells 3.98, C-reactive protein 43.5, arterial pH 7.5, pO2 53 mmHg, pCO2 31 mmHg and blood lactate concentration 1 mmol/L. Although the patient underwent a right pleurodesis 6 months ago, chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusion (loculated on the right side) as well as interstitial thickening (Fig. 1A), a common imaging feature in COVID-19. She underwent a naso-/oropharyngeal swab which turned positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid after being processed through a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Novel Coronavirus PCR Fluorescence Diagnostic Kit, BioGerm Medical Biotechnology). She started as an inpatient with 1 week of non-invasive assisted ventilation that reduced fever, clinical symptoms and normalized inflammatory laboratory values such as C-reactive protein. Still, respiratory function and blood oxygen levels remained poor despite an increase in FiO2 from 60 to 70%. Consequently, percutaneous drainage was requested with the aim of improving ventilation and blood oxygen saturation. The procedure was performed at the bedside in an isolated ward dedicated to COVID-19 patients. The operator wore an FFp2 mask, double gloves, protective glasses and a surgical gown (Fig. 2). After local anesthesia, two 8F multi-hole drainages were inserted bilaterally using dedicated US equipment in the isolated ward as image guidance. The procedure lasted approximately 1 h and was well tolerated. Around 1800 mL was drained in the next 5 h from both sides. All disposable equipment and devices were then immediately discarded in specific containers. Post-procedural chest X-rays showed a marked increase in the ventilated parenchyma. Along with clinical symptoms, also laboratory markers rapidly improved and blood saturation levels reached the normal range (SpO2 98%). The patient switched from assisted ventilation to a simple face mask (2 L/min O2) and maintained normal peripheral capillary oxygen saturation. At the time of writing, she is alive and close to hospital discharge.</text>

      <text>A former smoker 62-years old man was diagnosed with ALK-rearranged NSCLC in January 2020. A computed tomography (CT) scan performed in late December 2019 documented a tumor lesion in the right hilum and right lower paratracheal lymphadenopathy, associated with bilateral lung metastases. On January 31st, the patient started targeted therapy with alectinib for advanced disease. On March 16th the patient reported asthenia and dry cough, in absence of fever, which was treated with beclometasone/formoterol inhalations twice daily. Six days later (March 22nd), the patient developed ageusia, anosmia and night sweats, with concomitant resolution of cough. All the symptoms resolved on March 29th and did not require further medications. CT scan performed on March 30th, after two cycles of alectinib, showed partial response of disease and, collaterally, the onset of slight bilateral subpleuric ground-glass opacities (Fig. 1 ). Due to the lack of symptoms the patient was discharged without any specific medication and alectinib was continued. The test for SARS-CoV-2 was performed on RT-PCR on April 4th, and the result was negative. At the time of writing the manuscript, the patient was completely asymptomatic and was continuing targeted therapy.</text>

      <text>A never smoker 52 years-old man was diagnosed with advanced ROS1-positive NSCLC in September 2015. The patient was currently undergoing lorlatinib from November 2019, following brain progression of disease after failure of previous crizotinib. Since the beginning, the treatment was well tolerated and the patient achieved metabolic complete response of thoracic disease with decrease of brain lesions in January 2019, which was still documented at the last radiological assessment performed in February 2020. On the 9th of March 2020, the patient reported fever (until 39 °C) and dry cough, which worsened in the subsequent three days. After the admission to Emergency Service, a High-Resolution CT (HRCT) scan of the thorax (March 12th) showed the onset of multiple bilateral ground glass opacities, with a crazy paving pattern (Fig. 2 A). RT-PCR performed on March 13th was negative for SARS-CoV-2. The patient was treated with antibiotic treatment with azithromycin and ceftriaxone for 10 days since March 12th, and lorlatinib treatment was not discontinued. Six days after the beginning of antibiotic therapy, the symptoms were improved and the patient was weaned completely off oxygen supply. C-reactive protein values, which were high at the time of admission to the hospital (49 mg/L), were normalized on March 20th (3 mg/L). Due to remission of symptoms, the patient was discharged on March 23rd. A new CT scan performed on April 9th showed complete resolution of interstitial pneumonia (Fig. 2B).</text>

      <text>The study of Zhong et al. showed that acute respiratory distress (ARD) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was diagnosed amongst the whole spectrum of age, whereas 0.9% of patients were below the age of 15. The median age was 47, and 58.10% were males. The common clinical symptoms were fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%). Ground-glass opacity (50.0%) and bilateral patchy shadowing (46.0%) were typically found on chest computerized tomography (CT) scans. Figure 7 shows ground-glass opacity in the infected lungs of both male and female COVID-19 patients of similar age range. The median incubation period is 3.0 days (with incubation period ranging from 0 to 24 days). COVID-19 has a relatively lower fatality rate than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It was found that the mortality rate of 1.4%, based on the larger sample size studied, is lower than that reported previously. </text>

      <text>Previous Coronavirus epidemics SARS (2002), MERS (2012) and Influenza A subtype (H1N1) 2009, have demonstrated relatively similar and characteristic imaging findings. Subpleural patchy ground glass densities more so in the lung bases. [Figures 1 and 2]. With increasing severity of disease there is progression of ground glass densities to consolidation. [Figure 3] In severe cases there is diffuse alveolar damage - acute lung injury as well as complications of mechanical ventilation such as barotrauma [Figure 4]. Imaging findings in the current corona virus outbreak COVID-19 have demonstrated similar features on imaging. This is a great boon, as imaging specialists are already familiar with the appearances from SARS/H1N1 epidemics. In fact in the current pandemic it has been found characteristic HRCT appearances appear at the onset of disease occasionally before real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT_PCR) is positive which is used for definitive diagnosis of COVID-19. In fact a large study demonstrated HRCT to be positive in 88% of cases compared to RT PCR which was positive in 59% of cases. In view of this significant high predictive value of HRCT and relative false negative rate of RT PCR, it has been aggressively suggested to utilise HRCT in surveillance for COVID-19. Considering the only means to control the pandemic is by identifying positive cases, isolating them and quarantining their contacts during incubation and infectious phases. South Korea, which was affected early in the pandemic, resorted to identifying every positive case, isolating and quarantine all contacts. They were very successful with first 30 cases. Case 31 was given a bit of leeway which resulted in 80% of south korea infections- from one individual. South Korea had more than 8000 infections. It is imperative to detect every possible case. In view of the importance to detect every case, the recommendation to use HRCT for surveillance may not be aggressive at all. In fact, may turn the tide in the pandemic. A head to head comparison between HRCT and RT PCR. HRCT is easily available across india and the world. There are more than 3000 CT scanners in india. Nearly every district has one or multiple CT scanners. There are Only 52 RT PCR centres in india at this time. Time taken to obtain nasal swab and HRCT is relatively similar as just a breath hold scan required. Turn around time of result HRCT is instantaneous, RT PCR is 5 hours at present. Number of HRCT that can be done in a day could be 200 or much more per machine or more. Kasturba hospital mumbai has a capacity to do 300 RT PCR tests in a day. HRCT also has additional advantages as it helps assess the extent of pulmonary involvement, disease severity, thus helping to guide clinical management.</text>

In view of this significant high predictive value of HRCT and relative false negative rate of RT PCR, it has been aggressively suggested to utilise HRCT in surveillance for COVID-19. Considering the only means to control the pandemic is by identifying positive cases, isolating them and quarantining their contacts during incubation and infectious phases. South Korea, which was affected early in the pandemic, resorted to identifying every positive case, isolating and quarantine all contacts. They were very successful with first 30 cases. Case 31 was given a bit of leeway which resulted in 80% of south korea infections- from one individual. South Korea had more than 8000 infections. It is imperative to detect every possible case. In view of the importance to detect every case, the recommendation to use HRCT for surveillance may not be aggressive at all. In fact, may turn the tide in the pandemic. A head to head comparison between HRCT and RT PCR. HRCT is easily available across india and the world. There are more than 3000 CT scanners in india. Nearly every district has one or multiple CT scanners. There are Only 52 RT PCR centres in india at this time. Time taken to obtain nasal swab and HRCT is relatively similar as just a breath hold scan required. Turn around time of result HRCT is instantaneous, RT PCR is 5 hours at present. Number of HRCT that can be done in a day could be 200 or much more per machine or more. Kasturba hospital mumbai has a capacity to do 300 RT PCR tests in a day. HRCT also has additional advantages as it helps assess the extent of pulmonary involvement, disease severity, thus helping to guide clinical management.</text>

      <text>On February 11, 2020, a 75-year-old man with ESKD living in Wuhan was referred to Huoshenshan Hospital with a 2-week history of cough and chest tightness. Due to his symptoms and travel history, a chest CT was ordered (Fig. 1) and an oropharyngeal swab specimen was collected and tested with 2019 novel coronavirus RT-PCR assays several days before his hospitalization. The patient received 75 mg of oseltamivir orally twice daily. Immediately after the positive RT-PCR result was revealed, the patient was referred to Huoshenshan for hospitalization. A review of the patient's history showed that he had hypertension, chronic heart failure, COPD, and ESKD and was on routine hemodialysis. The patient had an atrophied right kidney, and in 2004, he underwent an open stone surgery for his nephrolithiasis in the left kidney. After the surgery, his renal function declined gradually and eventually entered hemodialysis in 2016. Due to the exhaustion of medical resources and travel restriction inside Wuhan city, the patient presented without dialysis for 5 days. His temperature was 36.8°C, respiratory rate was 23/min, heart rate was 100/min, and blood pressure was 139/89 mm Hg. His physical examination revealed pitting edema bilaterally in his lower limbs but was otherwise unremarkable.</text>

      <text>The patient was admitted to an airborne infection isolation unit with healthcare workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection. His oxygen saturation was 90% in room air and he was given oxygen therapy at 4-5 L/min flow rate. His oxygen saturation increased to 96%. Laboratory tests showed Cr 1,432.3 μmol/L, BUN 40 μmol/L, K+ 4.63 mmol/L, and uric acid 760 μmol/L. On February 12, 14, 16, 19, and 23, the patient was given continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration 5 times and decreased water retention for 2,400, 1,904, 1,500, 1,200, and 1,500 mL, respectively. The total duration of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration: blood flow, 120 mL/min; effluent flow rate, 1,000 mL/h; ultrafiltration rate, 150-200 mL/h; anticoagulation agent, heparin; vascular access site, right jugular vein) was 53 h (14, 12, 8, 10, and 9 h, respectively). Respiratory distress was relieved immediately after the first CRRT session and almost disappeared after three sessions. He was also administrated Arbidol 200 mg tid for 8 days from February 12. The laboratory tests were repeated on these days (Table 1). CRRT improved his BUN, serum Cr, uric acid, potassium, and C-reactive protein levels. The chest CT was repeated on February 22 (Fig. 1). An oropharyngeal swab specimen was collected twice and both tested negative in 2019 novel coronavirus RT-PCR assays on February 21 and 24, respectively. On February 26, his temperature was 36.6°C, respiratory rate was 17/min, heart rate was 79/min, blood pressure was 132/96 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation was 99% in room air. He met the criteria for hospital discharge in China (absence of clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities, and 2 negative PCR results). Then, the patient was discharged home on February 26.</text>

      <text>Shortly after returning to Southern California, he presented to our emergency department for further reevaluation. In the ED, a repeat chest X-ray (Fig. 1) demonstrated subtle patchy opacities in both lungs, new from prior X-ray 5 days ago. A CT (Fig. 1) of the chest revealed multifocal bilateral patchy ground glass opacities predominantly with peripheral distribution concerning for atypical pneumonia and possibly viral infection. COVID-19 testing was performed, the result of which was expected 48 h later, along with standard chemistry and hematology labs, which again revealed no abnormalities with the exception of an elevated procalcitonin level. An evaluation for other causes of atypical pneumonia was simultaneously sent, without additional findings thus far.</text>

      <text>He was admitted to the hospital on droplet-eye precautions. Initially, he was noted to have a temperature of 100.6°F, but with otherwise normal vital signs. He was initiated on antimicrobial therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Over the next 24 h, he was febrile to 101°F and respiratory status rapidly deteriorated. His repeat chest X-rays demonstrated evolution of the bilateral multifocal opacities consistent with the atypical pneumonia, and there was concern for superimposed pulmonary edema. He underwent dialysis the evening of hospital day 2; he tolerated the treatment poorly, developing new atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate despite only minimal ultrafiltration. His respiratory condition continued to rapidly decline during the night, and he had to be intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and shock. His pulmonary condition continued to deteriorate to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring continued mechanical ventilation with high PEEP &gt;10 cm and FiO2 &gt;60% as well as pressor support. In an effort to maintain close control of his volume status and metabolic parameters, we have initiated him on continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration. In the setting of ESRD, he has been deemed not a candidate for remdesivir compassionate use trial and was started on hydroxychloroquine and on hospital day 6 he was started on tocilizumab given continued hemodynamic instability with elevated inflammatory markers including interleukin (IL)-6. With the inability to rule out superimposed infection he has also been on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactom since hospital day 6. His clinical course is being followed closely by a multispecialist team, and depending on his trajectory, he may require paralysis as well as more aggressive pulmonary and hemodynamic support with proning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. At the current time, his vasopressor requirement remains variable, as does his PaO2/FiO2 ratio, while he remains in critical condition for the past 5 days. Table 1 summarizes timeline. Figure 1 shows chest X-ray and CT scans demonstrating interstitial pneumonitis due to COVID 19.</text>

      <text>Diagnosis is ultimately confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory or blood samples . Note that rRT-PCR positive-to-negative conversion has been reported at 6.9 ± 2.3 days . Some reports detail imaging findings suggestive of COVID-19, although these findings can be nonspecific and reliability has not yet been established . Computed tomography (CT) findings include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities, with peripheral posterior distribution, mainly in the lower lung lobes . Less commonly, septal thickening, bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, and subpleural involvement have been reported. As disease progression occurs, repeat CT scan may show multifocal consolidations with a paving pattern (Figure 5) .</text>

      <text>On 21 January 2020, a 28-year-old previously healthy Chinese man presented to Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, Chiang Mai, Thailand, with a 3-day history of high-grade fever and malaise. He also complained of rhinorrhea and cough, which had already resolved. He traveled from Jinzhou, China, to Chiang Mai on 15 January 2020 by trains and airplanes, with a brief transit in Wuhan, China. After his full itinerary was identified, his case was reported to the local government health agency as a patient under investigation for COVID-19. He was admitted to an airborne infection isolation room, and NP/OP swabs were obtained. The specimens were sent to two reference laboratories (the Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Sciences Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, and the Department of Medical Sciences, Ministry of Public Health) and tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by a real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay. His chest radiograph on hospital day 3 did not reveal any infiltration. He continued to be febrile without other respiratory symptoms. On hospital day 5, the NP/OP swabs were repeated and were again reported as negative for SARS-CoV-2. On hospital day 7, he developed nonproductive cough. The chest radiograph revealed bilateral lower lung infiltrates with prominence on the right (Fig. 1), which was compatible with viral pneumonia. Bronchoscopy and BAL were performed on hospital day 8, and BAL fluid tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. On hospital day 10, his overall clinical condition improved, with increasing appetite, and he was afebrile. He was discharged on hospital day 18.</text>

      <text>The 11 hospitalised health care providers were used as a comparator cohort. Nine were female. Median age was 32 years (range, 29–36 years). Nine were nurses, one, a physician and one, a health care attendant. (Supplementary Tables 1, 3 and 6). The 13 hospitalised subjects with haematological cancer and COVID-19 and the 11 hospitalised health care providers with COVID-19 had similar sex and age distributions (Table 2). Twelve haematological cancer subjects became febrile compared with four health care providers (P = 0.008), cough, twelve compared with four (P = 0.008) and dyspnoea, ten compared with three (P = 0.043). Lung CT scans of subjects with COVID-19 showed typical changes including patchy shadows, ground-glass opacity, air space consolidation or complete opacity (whiteout) but were similar between the cohorts (Fig. 1). At the start of the disease, subjects with haematological cancer and COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin, lower haemoglobin, lymphocyte and platelet concentrations but similar levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, compared with the cohort without haematological cancer. Some or all of these differences may be related to therapy of the haematological cancers rather than COVID-19.</text>

      <text>Amongst the 29 subjects with COVID-19, one had exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (the suspected origin site for SARS-CoV-2), seven had contact with clinically diagnosed persons with COVID-19 and one had contact with qRT-PCR-test confirmed person without COVID-19. The other 20 denied exposure to potential SARS-CoV-2 vectors. Sixteen subjects with COVID-19 were in ICUs before the COVID-19 pandemic began including eight subjects with haematological cancers and eight health care providers in the ICU as part of their work. These data compare with only 5 of 112 non-ICU subjects with haematological cancers (P &lt; 0.001) and with only 13 of 289 non-ICU subjects (hospitalised subjects with haematological cancers and health care providers; P &lt; 0.001). These data suggest more than one-half of COVID-19 cases we studied were ICU exposure related. In the case map an ICU nurse (patient 22) had the earliest onset time (Supplementary Fig. 1). There were correlations between and amongst more than one-half of the COVID-19 subjects we studied. We detected no more cases of COVID-19 amongst persons with a haematological cancer after the last cases with symptom onset of COVID-19 on January 31 (patient 2) and February 12 (patients 13 and 14), in Union Hospital and Wuhan Central Hospital. These data are consistent with a cluster of transmission related to ICU exposure in Union Hospital (Supplementary Tables 1–3 and Fig. 1).</text>

      <text>Chest radiographs obtained on admission showed peripheral ground-glass opacities in mid- and lower-third of the thorax (Fig. 1). Chest computed tomography on admission showed peripheral ground-glass opacities with partial occupation and also complete consolidation in mid- and lower-third of the thorax (Fig. 2a–c). We treated the patient with oxygen inhalation, antibiotics, and nutritional support. Blood gas analysis the second day of hospitalization showed that PCO2 was 31.3 mm Hg (reference 33–40 mm Hg), PO2 was 62.4 mm Hg (reference 70–80 mm Hg), pH was 7.42 (reference 7.36–7.44), HCO3 was 19.9 (reference 21–27 mmol/L), base excess − 3.4 (reference − 3 to + 3 mmol/L), and SO2 was 92%, showing a compensated respiratory alkalosis (Table 1). The patient remains stable with no signs of respiratory distress, a saturation of peripheral oxygen was 94%, room air, but with a temperature of 38.4 °C and cephalea, both solved with acetaminophen. At the second day patient also received oseltamivir (orally 75 mg q12h).</text>

It demonstrates thickening of the lung texture. Figure 6b shows an axial CT image of common type patient (6 days from symptom onset to CT scan). It illustrates multiple ground-glass opacities in both lungs. Figures 6c shows an axial CT image of severe type patient. It demonstrates extensive ground-glass opacities and pulmonary consolidation, enlargement of bronchi, and vessels. Figure 6d demonstrates an axial CT image of critical type patient (9 days from symptom onset to CT scan). It illustrates extensive ground-glass opacities in several lobes, formatting “white lung.”</text>

      <text>All five patients showed marked improvement in chest radiographic abnormalities after active intervention. On the early and mid-term follow-up CTs, Two patients (Figs. 3A–F, 4A–F) showed an increase in the extent and density of consolidations, whereas one patient (Fig. 2A–F) showed a lesser extent of consolidation but more ground-glass opacities. On the late follow-up CT, one patient (Fig. 1) showed consolidations that had been completely resolved and four patients (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5) showed significantly reduced consolidations; however, in one patient, small amounts of patchy ground-glass opacities and fibrous stripes in bilateral lungs still persisted (Fig. 5). As of February 19, 2020, all five patients had successfully recovered and discharged. Fitness for discharge included body temperature returning to normal for at least three consecutive days, significant improvement of acute exudative lesions on chest CT imaging, and viral clearance in respiratory samples from the upper respiratory tract (two consecutive negative results of COVID-19).</text>

      <text>All five patients showed marked improvement in chest radiographic abnormalities after active intervention. On the early and mid-term follow-up CTs, Two patients (Figs. 3A–F, 4A–F) showed an increase in the extent and density of consolidations, whereas one patient (Fig. 2A–F) showed a lesser extent of consolidation but more ground-glass opacities. On the late follow-up CT, one patient (Fig. 1) showed consolidations that had been completely resolved and four patients (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5) showed significantly reduced consolidations; however, in one patient, small amounts of patchy ground-glass opacities and fibrous stripes in bilateral lungs still persisted (Fig. 5). As of February 19, 2020, all five patients had successfully recovered and discharged. Fitness for discharge included body temperature returning to normal for at least three consecutive days, significant improvement of acute exudative lesions on chest CT imaging, and viral clearance in respiratory samples from the upper respiratory tract (two consecutive negative results of COVID-19).</text>

      <text>Chest CT showed multiple diffuse patchy consolidation areas and ground-glass opacities in both lungs (Fig. 1). There was interlobular septal thickening with pleural effusion and bronchiectasis. The adjacent pleura showed reactive thickening, without mediastinal lymphadenopathy. According to a scoring method published in the literature, the total lung severity score of the patient was 19 out of 20. Besides, we found pneumatosis extending from the mediastinal pericardium to the bilateral cervical soft tissue space (Fig. 1A–D). The patient was considered to have spontaneous pneumomediastinum because no other sources of mediastinal air could be identified. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is uncommon in virus pneumonia. It was reported in cases with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus pneumonia. Once it appears, the patient's condition could be serious with worse prognosis. Real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction of the patient's sputum was positive for the COVID-19 nucleic acid. Despite combined antiviral drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, and supportive care, unfortunately, the patient succumbed to illness two days later due to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome.</text>

      <text>A 57-year-old man, without history of respiratory disease, presented to the emergency department with a 3-hour history of hemoptysis in Hunan, China. He denied recent travel to Wuhan City, Hubei Province, or any exposure to 2019-nCoV. No supportive results were found in laboratory tests upon admission. A unenhanced CT scan of the chest showed a localized area of ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe (Fig. 1). This patient was admitted to the hospital with a suspicion of pulmonary infection or tuberculosis. Three days after admission, a small amount of pleural effusion was seen. No affirmative results were found in the drainage of pleural effusion. Hemoptysis was unable to be controlled after symptomatic treatments including hemostasis and anti-infection therapy. Eight days later, a follow-up chest CT scan showed that the GGO in the left upper lobe had evolved into consolidation (Fig. 2). The GGO appeared on the superior segment of the left lower lobe. Bleeding was confirmed in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe by using a fiber bronchoscope on the 10th day after admission. Fever occurred on the 11th day and the patient reached their highest body temperature of 39℃. Dyspnea was present on 14th day and gradually increased. On day 18 post admission, the GGOs and consolidation in the medial aspect of the left upper lobe decreased, while diffuse GGO and consolidation increased in the remaining areas of the lungs. The patient showed diffuse haziness in both lungs, batwing appearance, crazy-paving appearance, and the air-bronchogram sign. GGO was also distributed along the peripheral or subpleural regions (Fig. 3). The COVID-19 infection was eventually confirmed by a real time reverse-transcription-polymerase chain-reaction assay. The hemoptysis gradually decreased and the dyspnea was relieved with symptomatic treatment and antiviral therapy according to the Guidelines and Management for COVID-19. A chest CT scan showed that the consolidation in both lungs were obviously absorbed; the GGO region enlarged but the GGO density decreased on day 24 (Fig. 4A, B). On day 29 post admission, GGO and a small patch of consolidation continued to be absorbed. Initial GGO on the first CT scan and the initial GGO and consolidation on the second CT scan in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe were obviously absorbed (Fig. 4C, D). This study was approved by the ethics board of Hunan province Hospital, and the informed consent for present study was waived.</text>

      <text>The initial chest CT showed ground-glass opacities (GGO) in the left lower lobe (Fig. 1A). Over the next 10 days, the lesions increased in extent and density and progressed to consolidation (Fig. 1B–D). The clinical symptoms deteriorated, and acute respiratory distress syndrome was diagnosed. A follow-up CT scan revealed emphysema (Figs.1D, 2A, B). After 15 days of supportive treatment, chest CT showed an improvement in the pulmonary lesions, disappearance of the mediastinal emphysema, and appearance of a giant bulla in the left lung (Figs. 1E, F, 2C, D). Eight days later, the final follow-up CT scan revealed a small pneumothorax and pleural effusion in the left thorax (Figs. 1F, 2E, F).</text>

      <text>This case, occurring in the epicenter of the COVID-19 pneumonia outbreak, illustrates the potential severity of this disease. Serial follow-up chest CT showed the progression of the pulmonary lesions into confluent bilateral consolidation with a lower lung predominance. The patient did not have a history of pneumothorax or any underlying pulmonary disease; no abnormalities, such as a small bulla or emphysema, were observed in the initial CT scan. The patient had no history of smoking. As a result of diffuse alveolar injury in severe COVID-19 pneumonia, the alveoli may be prone to rupturing. Furthermore, the patient developed a pronounced cough, which may also induce alveolar rupture. Mediastinal emphysema results from a sudden increase in the alveolar pressure, causing alveolar rupture and air leakage with interstitial emphysema; this can be observed in the severe acute respiratory syndrome. In addition to the giant bulla, chest CT also revealed multiple bullae in the subpleural lung zones (arrowheads; Fig. 2C, E), where pneumonic consolidation was more prominent than in the contralateral areas, which could easily rupture and cause pneumothorax. While mediastinal emphysema and pneumothorax are well-known complications of mechanical ventilation, the patient only received HFNC oxygen therapy before the emphysema occurred. Therefore, in this particular case, we speculate that the mediastinal emphysema and pneumothorax may be related to COVID-19 pneumonia.</text>

      <text>On admission, the patient presented with fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, and an occasional dry cough. He denied travelling to Wuhan or any exposure to infected patients. He had undergone surgery of the duodenal papillary carcinoma 17 years ago. His body temperature was elevated to 37.5℃ (99.5°F) and coarse breath sounds were heard in both lungs at auscultation. Laboratory studies showed elevation of C-reactive protein (203 mg/L; normal range, 0–10 mg/L), procalcitonin (0.100 ng/mL; normal range, 0–0.5 ng/mL), and D-dimer (1.13 mg/L; normal range, 0–0.55 mg/L). The white blood cell differential count showed 80.0% neutrophils and 9.9% lymphocytes. Unenhanced chest computed tomography (CT) scan manifested multiple peripheral lesions in both lungs. This patient contained all the characteristics of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV. Some of the lesions presented with pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) (Fig. 1A), GGO with interlobular septal thickening (Fig. 1B), GGO with consolidation (Fig. 1C), or prominent consolidation (Fig. 1D). Most of the lesions were contained with consolidated composition, and no lung cavitation, pleural effusions, or lymphadenopathy were found. However, despite a long disease course and extensive lung lesions, this patient's first RT-PCR result was negative, indicating a low sputum viral load.</text>

      <text>A 44-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital due to fever. She had a history of exposure to a patient with unexplained fever 3 days previously. The patient developed fever (37.8℃), accompanied by myalgia one day after contact with the patient. Initial laboratory investigation revealed the following: decreased leukocyte count (3.74 × 109/L), normal neutrophil ratio (46.2%), and increased monocyte ratio (21.9%). Chest CT images showed a small solitary ground-glass nodule on January 24 (Fig. 1A). Soon the patient's sputum tested positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. On January 29, the nodule had enlarged with ground-glass opacities on follow-up CT images (Fig. 1B). The initial nodules showed absorption changes and the typical radiological manifestation of COVID-19 infection began to appear in the whole lung on February 1 (Fig. 1C). With the progression of infection, the patient showed abnormal results in laboratory investigations on February 8; the neutrophil ratio was increased (77.8%), the lymphocyte ratio was decreased (12.4%), the monocytes ratio was decreased (9.8%), and the lymphocyte count was decreased (0.68 × 109/L). After antiviral and symptomatic treatment, most of the lesions had been absorbed and some residues still existed in the peripheral lung on the latest follow-up CT images (Fig. 1D). She has since been cured, testing negative for viral nucleic acid.</text>

      <text>A 51-year-old man had a history of contact with a patient with confirmed COVID-19. He initially denied any clinical symptoms on January 23. Because of his history of exposure to a confirmed patient, he was asked to stay in isolation at home. However, on baseline chest CT images, a small ill-defined ground-glass nodule was suspected in his left lower lobe (Fig. 2A). On January 30, he began to have a fever (37.8℃) with chest pain and his C-reactive protein level was slightly increased (8.7 mg/L); therefore, he underwent a further chest CT scan. A confluent crazy-paving appearance presented in the same location as the nodule on chest CT images (Fig. 2B). Because of medical resource pressures from the COVID-19 outbreak, the patient was treated at home with antiviral agents. The latest follow-up chest CT images showed that the lesioned area had become smaller and the density had begun to decrease on February 13 (Fig. 2C). The patient remains under close observation although the clinical symptoms have disappeared.</text>

      <text>A 48-year-old man was admitted to hospital due to fever (38.3℃) and myalgia with a history of exposure to a patient with COVID-19 infection 6 days previously. Initial laboratory investigation revealed an increased C-reactive protein level (37.58 mg/L); all other indicators were normal. On baseline chest CT images, there was a sub-centimeter ground-glass nodule with an ill-defined margin in the right middle lobe during a period when the patient did not present with any symptoms (Fig. 3A). On subsequent chest CT images, the initial nodules had become larger. Grid-like vessels passing through the lesion were thickened and an air bronchogram appeared in the lesion (Fig. 3B). Ground-glass opacities began to appear in both lower lobes (Fig. 3C). On admission, his body temperature peaked (39.0℃). The RT-PCR of the patient's sputum tested positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid on February 17. The latest chest CT images showed diffuse parenchymal abnormalities in the periphery of the whole lungs (Fig. 3D).</text>

      <text>A 54-year-old man came to the Imam Khomeini hospital complex, Tehran, Iran due to shaking chills, dry cough, nausea, and vomiting during the outbreak of COVID-2019. In the emergency room, he had tachypnoea (respiratory rate 32/min), temperature 37.3°C, and O2 saturation of 76%, so he was admitted to the ward. Baseline ECG was normal (Panel A). High-resolution computed tomography showed bilateral ground-glass appearance (Panel B). PCR of the nasopharyngeal swab documented coronavirus infection. He was administered an antiviral and hydroxychloroquine. On the 13th day of hospital stay, due to aggravation of tachypnoea, he was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit. Next morning, the patient suddenly developed complete heart block (CHB) (Panel C). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed for ∼10 min until resumption of normal sinus rhythm (Pancel D). Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular size and function with ejection fraction up to 50% without pericardial effusion. The patient remained in sinus rhythm until 30 March 30 when he died due to severe respiratory failure.</text>

      <text>On admission, the physical examination showed that vital signs were within normal ranges except for pharyngeal hyperemia. A chest computed tomographic (CT) scan was reported as showing patchy shadows and ground-glass opacity in the right lung (Figure 1A). Laboratory results reflected there were alterations in hepatic function measures and mildly abnormal myocardial zymogram (Table 1). Lymphocyte count, platelet count, CD8+ T lymphocyte count, and serum immunoglobulin (Ig)M level were all mildly elevated. Other laboratory examinations including hemoglobin, D-dimer, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and renal function in this patient showed no abnormalities. Both rotavirus in stool and cytomegalovirus deoxyribonucleic acid in blood were negative. Based on the definite contact history and the above test results, the infant was diagnosed as COVID-19 (ordinary type). She was isolated and treated empirically with the inhaled interferon α-1b (15 μg, bid), amoxicillin potassium clavulanate (30 mg/kg, q8h, intravenous glucose tolerance test [IVGTT]), reduced glutathione, ursodeoxycholic acid, and traditional Chinese medicine lotus qingwen.</text>

      <text>On days 2 through 6 of hospitalization (days 7 through 11 of illness), the patient became sicker, presenting as a frequently productive cough accompanied by occasional tachycardia (150–170 beats per minute). Decreased arterial oxygen partial pressures (lowest PaO2, 56 mmHg) with elevated lactic acid while breathing ambient air were found in the morming of hospital day 4 (Figure 2). She received sputum suctioning. Meanwhile, oxygen was supplied through a nasal cannula immediately, and ambroxol was administrated to eliminate phlegm. Because there was a trend of aggravation in the disease grade, a second chest CT scan was performed in the evening of hospital day 4 (illness day 9), which showed evidence of progressive pneumonia (Figure 1B). These radiographic findings coincided with a progress in respiratory status. Abnormal myocardial zymogram on admission and increased troponin I (0.025 μg per liter) on hospital day 4 indicated myocardia injury, so intravenous sodium creatine phosphate was added to protect her heart. During this period, the baby still had a good appetite, without diarrhea, oliguria, or shock. On day 11 of the patient’s illness, a stool specimen was collected for the first time to detect the viral RNA, and the PCR result showed positive.</text>

      <text>On days 7 through 12 of hospitalization (days 12 through 17 of illness), the patient’s clinical condition gradually improved and the respiratory symptoms disappeared on hospital day 11. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and her oxygen saturation values were 94% to 100% while breathing ambient air. The heart rate fluctuated between 120 and 140 beats per minute. The laboratory examinations on hospital day 10 showed elevated myocardial zymogram and abnormal liver function both recovered. On hospital day 11 (illness day 16), a third chest CT scan showed patchy shadows and ground-glass opacity were obviously absorbed (Figure 1C). In view of the patient’s clinical manifestations and other laboratory findings, the Citrobacter freundii in 2 sputum cultures was considered as a colonized bacteria of the respiratory tract and was not being treated. Three pharyngeal swabs obtained from hospital day 10 to hospital day 13 were found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR assays. Amoxicillin potassium clavulanate was discontinued on hospital day 11, and interferon α-1b was discontinued on the following day. According to the latest interim guidance of the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment in China, the patient met the discharge criteria. However, we found that her anal swabs collected on hospital day 11 and 13 were still positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Thus, the patient remained hospitalized. From February 16, 2020, she was transferred to another hospital for continued isolation and observation. In the process of manuscript revision, we have learned that she was still asymptomatic during this period, and the anal swab collected on February 28, 2020 was negative for this viral RNA.</text>

      <text>Pulmonary involvement was seen on CT images of all infected HCWs, and most of the CT abnormalities were bilateral pneumonia (Appendix Table 4). The CT scans of the two suspected infected HCWs were shown in Fig. 3 . The most frequent findings on CT images were ground-glass opacifications (86%), which located in peripheral parenchyma (50%) or in both peripheral and central parenchyma (36%). The ground-glass opacifications in all infected HCWs were multifocal. Subsegmental areas of consolidation could be identified in six (43%) infected HCWs and patchy reticular changes subpleural areas in two (14%). Importantly, ground-glass opacification and/or consolidation stably resolved in 10 (71%) infected HCWs on serial CT images during hospitalization; however, such abnormalities demonstrated a deterioration for a couple of days and then an improvement in 4 (29%) infected HCWs. Bilateral pleural effusion appeared in one (7%).</text>

      <text>In “Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for Coronavirus Disease (Trial Version 6)”, infection is classified according to its clinical symptoms and imaging manifestations. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the imaging stage (early, advanced, and severe) and clinical classification (mild, general, and severe) in most patients with COVID-19. ① Early-stage and mild type (mild patients have mild clinical symptoms and no significant imaging findings such as pneumonia performance). ② Progressive stage and common type (general type patients have fever, respiratory tract symptoms, and imaging shows pneumonia). ③ Severe stage and severe type (Patients with shortness of breath and hypoxemia. The images mainly show diffuse lung lesions, some of which manifest “white lung” changes; the range of lesions within 24–48 h significantly progresses &gt;50%). There are, however, some cases which do not comply to the above one-to-one correspondence. ① Some cases have obvious imaging manifestations, but the clinical symptoms are atypical (Fig. 1 ). Among the close-contact cases diagnosed through screening as having COVID-19, most patients had no obvious clinical symptoms at the initial diagnosis, and the corresponding clinical symptoms appeared after a period of time; a few patients showed no obvious clinical symptoms for a long period, with the infection becoming “invisible ”. However, the images of the above cases did show pneumonia at the time of screening, the signs of which were mainly ground glass and patchy shadows under the pleura or outside the lungs. ② The clinical manifestations of some cases are typical, and no obvious manifestations of pneumonia were found on imaging examination (Fig. 2 ). This may relate to the virus being mainly located in the upper respiratory tract and not causing exudative lesions in the lung. Such patients should be diagnosed, isolated, and treated early to prevent transmission of the virus. ③ In some cases, the clinical symptoms are relieved, and the imaging manifestations have progressed (Fig. 3 ). The mismatch between clinical and imaging manifestations becomes a difficult problem for COVID-19 diagnosis. Therefore, comprehensive analysis of clinical data, epidemiology and imaging performance is more helpful for the diagnosis of COVID-19.</text>

Among the close-contact cases diagnosed through screening as having COVID-19, most patients had no obvious clinical symptoms at the initial diagnosis, and the corresponding clinical symptoms appeared after a period of time; a few patients showed no obvious clinical symptoms for a long period, with the infection becoming “invisible ”. However, the images of the above cases did show pneumonia at the time of screening, the signs of which were mainly ground glass and patchy shadows under the pleura or outside the lungs. ② The clinical manifestations of some cases are typical, and no obvious manifestations of pneumonia were found on imaging examination (Fig. 2 ). This may relate to the virus being mainly located in the upper respiratory tract and not causing exudative lesions in the lung. Such patients should be diagnosed, isolated, and treated early to prevent transmission of the virus. ③ In some cases, the clinical symptoms are relieved, and the imaging manifestations have progressed (Fig. 3 ). The mismatch between clinical and imaging manifestations becomes a difficult problem for COVID-19 diagnosis. Therefore, comprehensive analysis of clinical data, epidemiology and imaging performance is more helpful for the diagnosis of COVID-19.</text>

      <text>The gold standard for diagnosis of COVID-19 is a positive nucleic acid test with high specificity, and a low sensitivity of 30–50%. It is common in clinical work to find that clinical and imaging findings support the diagnosis of COVID-19 while multiple consecutive nucleic acid tests are negative (Fig. 4 ). It has been reported that up to eight nucleic acid tests have been negative in infected patients before COVID-19 was finally diagnosed. Over-reliance on nucleic acid tests may lead to the misdiagnosis of patients who do in fact have COVID-19. This is not conducive to the control of the epidemic. Preliminary data from a designated virus hospital in Wuhan showed that the CT positive rate of clinically highly suspected cases was ≥90%, while the positive rate of nucleic acid tests was about 40%. This is due to the many factors which affect the nucleic acid test such as the course of infection, viral load, sampling method, detection reagents, and interpretation standards. Reagents in particular greatly affect the detection effect. Therefore, nucleic acid test cannot be a factor in restricting the accurate diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The director of the radiology department of a hospital in Wuhan strongly recommends CT scan as the main diagnostic and screening basis for COVID-19. The “Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for Coronavirus Disease (Trial Version 5)” specifically formulated clinical diagnosis standards for patients in Hubei Province, and defined suspected cases with pneumonia imaging manifestations as “clinical diagnostic cases”, which reduced the risk of further spread.</text>

      <text>With the exception of the above cases, some mild cases had no obvious imaging changes of pneumonia, but the nucleic acid test was negative (Fig. 5 ). The use of imaging pneumonia as a prerequisite for the diagnosis of COVID-19 may lead to clinicians focusing solely on patients with pneumonia and missing the diagnosis of infected patients who show no changes in pneumonia. The “Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for Coronavirus Disease (Trial Version 4)” stipulates that a patient who meets any one of the epidemiological history criteria and any two of the clinical manifestations can be included in suspected cases, and that an etiological test then be conducted. Such an approach is conducive to the detection of patients with COVID-19.</text>

      <text>Pneumonia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been reported since last December in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 can develop a condition called coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19), which can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and even death; therefore, detection of the infection is pivotal, as is making an early initial assessment so that subsequent planning of appropriate treatment and careful follow-up can be prepared in advance (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2 ).</text>

      <text>On February 7, 2020, a 68-year-old male was admitted to hospital for “paroxysmal vomiting for 7 days, fever for 1 day”. The patient developed paroxysmal vomiting 7 days ago. He bought antiemetic at the pharmacy, and his vomiting symptoms eased slightly after taking the antiemetic. One day before admission, he had a fever with a temperature of 38.0 °C. He has no history of exposure to Wuhan, but his nephew had a history of exposure to Wuhan. On admission, his chest CT showed pneumonia in the bilateral lungs and ground-glass opacities in the right lung. We suspected that he was infected with SARS-CoV-2. A pharyngeal swab sample and stool sample were collected. On admission, the count of total T lymphocyte decreased and IL-6 slightly increased. There were no obvious abnormal in hepatic function and renal function (Fig. 1 and Table 1). </text>

Secondary to previous activity level and dome impaction, the operative plan was for limited internal fixation followed by delayed total hip arthroplasty following the COVID pandemic in an effort to minimize potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 and optimize resource allocation. Pre-COVID-19, the surgeon's preference would have been for a limited open reduction and internal fixation immediately followed by total hip arthroplasty in the same setting. Intraoperative stress examination after limited fixation demonstrated a stable hip.</text>

      <text>The x-ray of the first patient manifested “white lung” before surgery (Fig. 1A). Lung transplantation occurred on March 1. Donor lungs were acquired by COTRS protocol. During the operation, we found no visible pleural effusion in the thorax cavity, and the right heart of the recipient was enlarged and turned clockwise. The shape of the resected lungs was complete, dark red, tough, without apparent mass, and the surface was uneven. The lungs were consolidated entirely in the cross-section, without noticeable mucus (Fig. 1B). The patient's vital signs were stable after surgery, but 40 hours later, she showed a remarkably decreased oxygenation index, and CT scan presented an extensive consolidation of the donor's lungs. Those manifestations suggested acute rejection. Steroid pulse therapy was used to control rejection (methylprednisolone 500 mg/day for 3 days, then weaning 40 mg daily to a final dose of 40 mg/day). After the first dose, the patient's oxygenation index improved rapidly, and the chest x-ray became clear (Fig. 1C). The ECMO was removed successfully on the fifth day.</text>

      <text>On March 8, the second patient underwent bilateral lung transplantation after the nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 turned to negative for 20 days. His lungs gradually lost function as the disease progressed before surgery (Fig. 1D). Similar to the first patient, we found no visible pleural effusion in the thorax, and the recipient's heart was healthy. The resected lungs exhibited extensive consolidation, but they were softer than the first patient's lungs (Fig. 1E). Considering the high proportion of HLA mismatch between donor and recipient, we used high-dose methylprednisolone (methylprednisolone 500 mg/day for 3 days, then weaning 40 mg daily to a final dose of 40 mg/day) to prevent acute rejection after surgery. This patient's condition was stable, and ECMO was withdrawn on the second day after surgery. The chest x-ray showed the transplant lungs were clear (Fig. 1F).</text>

      <text>We observed 2 cases of mild thrombocytopenia (Table). In these cases, we observed a re-bleeding (Figures 3 and 4) that led from a rapid neurological worsening to death within 5 d. This condition could be related to COVID-19 infection, as reported in literature. Independently from the hemorrhagic risk, Lippi et al showed that low platelet count is associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and this should serve as clinical indicator of worsening illness during hospitalization. In our series, we suppose that thrombocytopenia led to re-bleeding and was associated with poor outcome.</text>

      <text>All of the patients in our study presented exudative changes, with different degrees of patchy consolidation or ground-glass opacities, on CT images (Fig. 2a–c). The processing of CT images (Fig. 2a) revealed that the chest presented only scattered dotted shadows on the first day of admission, focal exudation on the fourth day, and diffuse ground-glass shadows on the 13th day. A good example of a case gradually improved with effective therapy is presented in Fig. 2b. In addition, there were patients whose condition progressed rapidly within 1 week (Fig. 2c). On the first day of admission, the chest CT scan was basically normal. However, on the seventh day, the chest CT scan showed patchy high-density shadow and diffused ground glass density shadow in both lungs. Soon after, this patient died of multiple organ failure (Fig. 2c). These results suggest that CT imaging is an important method in differential diagnosis and evaluating the severity of COVID-19. </text>

      <text>According to our standardized program, all patients with a clinical suspicion for aorto-iliac and/or infrainguinal ALI and/or upper limb ischemia underwent routine preoperative screening blood tests including creatine-phosphokinase (CPK) and D-dimer levels, along with chest radiograph and electrocardiogram (ECG). Preoperative computed tomography scan was performed to identify COVID-19 related pneumonia (Figure 1 ). These studies were performed in the Emergency Room in order to avoid cross-contamination and unnecessary risk of viral spread. Patients with suspected aorto-iliac occlusion underwent computed-tomography angiography (CT-A) to assess the extent of disease and vessel sizing (Figure 2 A,B). Patients who presented with infrainguinal and/or upper limb occlusive disease underwent echo-color-Doppler evaluation of both the arterial and venous systems. Also, during the course of hospitalization all patients were screened for the identification of eventual cardiac emboli sources by means of transthoracic echocardiography. Operative risk profile was defined using a multidisciplinary evaluation which included the physical examination and laboratory blood tests.</text>

      <text>Two hours after admission, an unenhanced chest CT-scan displayed typical signs of COVID-19 pneumonia (mostly ground glass opacity without CT-backed evidence of another infection) with critical extent (&gt; 75% of pulmonary parenchyma) (Fig. 1 ). The upper abdominal slices showed a spontaneous hyperdensity (71 Hounsfied units (HU) vs 38 HU in the portal vein) in the right portal vein (Fig. 2 a, 4b). Further examination with enhanced CT-Scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis at the arterial and portal phases, performed at the same time, confirmed a right-portal vein thrombosis (Fig. 2b) originating from thrombosis of the distal part of the upper mesenteric vein extended to the spleno-mesaraic trunk. A proximal thrombosis of the upper mesenteric artery (Fig. 3 a-b) and jejunal artery were also observed with subsequent features of bowel ischemia of the caecum and small intestine (Fig. 4 a-b) with small amount of liquid in the peritoneal cavity. No pulmonary embolism was revealed. Laparotomy was undertaken few hours later and confirmed ischemia, where a meter of necrotic ileum and right colon were removed. Thrombolysis and thrombectomy of the upper mesenteric artery were also performed during the same procedure. Despite timely treatment, his medical condition stayed precarious because of extended bowel ischemia in addition to severe lung damage caused by COVID-19. Palliative cares was implemented and the patient passed away 4 days later.</text>

      <text>From January to February 2020, 4 patients with common COVID-19 were admitted and treated, and all 4 patients had a similar history from the Wuhan epidemic area and contact with patients confirmed with the disease. Three were female and 1 was male; 3 were young adults and 1 elderly. All 4 patients had fever not higher than 38.5°C. There were 2 cases of pharyngeal discomfort, 2 cases of dry cough, 1 case of productive cough, 1 case of muscle pain, 2 cases of headache, and 2 cases of fatigue (Table 1). None of the 4 patients showed nasal congestion, runny nose, vomiting, diarrhea, chest tightness, or shortness of breath. Chest examinations showed no positive signs, such as rhonchi or moist crackles, in both lungs. Peripheral blood leukocyte and lymphocyte decreased significantly in only 1 case. A pharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) test was performed in 1 patient that was initially negative, 1 patient with twice negative, and 2 patients with initial positive. As for SARS-CoV-2 RNA pharyngeal swab test results, 1 was initial negative, 1 was twice negative, and 2 were initial positive (Table 2). Chest X-ray examinations were negative in all patients. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans showed multiple plaque, interstitial changes, and ground glass opacity in all 4 patients; a small amount of bilateral pleural effusion was observed in 1 patient (Figure 1; see Table 2).</text>

The chest radiograph showed peribronchial ground-glass opacities in both lungs, although there was no obvious flu-like symptom such as cough, sputum, sore throat, or fever (Fig. 1). COVID-19 was confirmed on March 19, 2020, on the basis of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay that detected SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, anti-viral agents (lopinavir/ritonavir), empirical antibiotics, and symptomatic respiratory treatment for COVID-19 infection as well as treatment for DKA were also performed. The DKA was improved after proper insulin treatment, but the dyspnea and radiologic finding worsened. Mechanical ventilation was initiated on the fourth day of admission. He received intensive treatments such as continuous renal replacement therapy (6th day after admission) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (13th day after admission).</text>

      <text>The case is a 49-year-old woman, presented in January 2020 mainly for abdominal distention, who was diagnosed with ovarian serous carcinoma after imaging and scrutiny of ascites. She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy because of para-aortic and closed lymph node metastasis and peritoneal dissemination, which was considered to be stage IIIC. She had diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and glaucoma. Neoadjuvant paclitaxel and carboplatin were started on February 18, the second cycle of paclitaxel and carboplatin with the addition of bevacizumab was started on March 10, and the third cycle of paclitaxel and carboplatin with bevacizumab was also given on April 2. On April 15, contrast computed tomography (CT) scan for therapeutic evaluation showed bilateral and peripheral dominant, heterogeneous ground-glass opacities and consolidation in the lower lobes of both lungs, which have been reported as images of COVID-19 pneumonia (Fig. 2). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing performed the next day was negative, but considering the possibility of a false negative PCR result, we decided to take the case as COVID-19 pneumonia, although it was necessary to differentiate the drug-induced pneumonia. Because of the absence of fever and respiratory symptoms, it was decided to keep her in isolation at home, but the planned fourth cycle of paclitaxel and carboplatin therapy was postponed. We are now closely monitoring the changes in her general condition.</text>

      <text>The first case was a 56-year old woman who had a diagnosis of high-grade serous ovarian cancer IIa after primary debulking surgery on October 17, 2019. There was no residual tumor after the surgery. She received the fifth cycle of adjuvant paclitaxel-carboplatin on February 2, 2020. Because of her exposure to COVID-19 confirmed patient at a nursing home in Daegu where one of the significant COVID-19 clusters occurred, she got confirmatory testing for COVID-19 and chest CT scan. Fortunately, PCR test result was reported negative and she had no relevant symptoms. However, the physician decided to postpone the sixth cycle of paclitaxel-carboplatin not only because chest CT showed abnormal finding of early atypical pneumonia (Fig. 3), but also because she visited another nursing home in Daegu against the advice of her oncologist which also had significant COVID-19 cluster. She did not resume her adjuvant chemotherapy schedule although COVID-19 was negative. Watchful monitoring and follow-up started.</text>

      <text>The patient was a 60-year-old male with prior history of hypertension and recently elevated blood glucose. One month ago, he presented with dry cough and low-grade fever at 37.5 °C, so quarantined and rest at home considering the occupied hospitals in Wuhan in early February, as the timeline depicted in Figure 1. Then sudden onset of drastic vomiting and long duration of chest discomfort tortured him a whole night without obvious relief, then he was sent to the Wuhan Asia Heart Hospital by family in the next day. Markers of myocardial injury were significantly elevated, such as troponin T was 11,500 ng/L, natriuretic peptide was up to 4,121 ng/L, and nucleic acid test of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was positive. The ECG showed ST-segments were elevated significantly in inferior wall leads and mildly elevated in posterior wall leads, whereas depressed in anterior wall. Following chest computed tomography showed both signs of ground glass opacity (GGO) as viral pneumonia and pulmonary edema indicating heart failure (Figure 2). The diagnosis was ST-segment elevated acute myocardial infarction concomitant with COVID-19. Since the percutaneous coronary intervention was not available during the epidemic, while thrombolysis was not applicable due to the delay time more than 12 h, only intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and noninvasive ventilator were implemented for nearly three weeks. Meanwhile, the antiviral drugs and traditional Chinese medicine were prescribed considering the concomitant COVID-19. After the vital signs of the patient were prone to be stable, the instruments were weaning and then the patient was transferred to Infectious Diseases Department of Huoshenshan Hospital. However, the patient felt short of breath immediately after the admission and accompanied by drastic cough. Since either COVID-19 or angina post myocardial infarction was possible pathogenesis of these symptoms, how to evaluate and manage such tough scenario is critical. Considering the convenience and rapidness of wireless equipment, we performed auscultation with wireless stethoscope first and heard the gallop rhythm and reflex murmur in mitral valve zone. Then we performed ECG using waistband-shaped tele-ECG, which indicated severe ischemia in inferior wall as II, III, and aVF leads, and it also reflected by the mirror leads (Figure 3). We judged that the patient suffered angina post infarction and congestive heart failure during the long way transport, and then immediately prescribed nitroglycerine and furosemide for vasodilation as well as preload reduction. Thereafter, the symptoms of the patient relieved in ten minutes. Then second chest computed tomography proved aforementioned diagnosis and showed gradual absorption of GGO of the patient. Following echocardiography also showed decreased left ventricular ejection fraction as 43% and observed severe mitral regurgitation found by wireless stethoscope. The serum brain natriuretic peptide level was still elevated at 800 ng/L in supporting the diagnosis of heart failure. After that, dual anti-platelet drugs, anti-ischemia agents, and diuretics as optimal medication of acute myocardial infarction were given, as well as the COVID-19 treatment according to the guideline. After a period of treatment, the patient recovered well without the symptom of shortness of breath or cough during supine. In order to improve the prognosis furtherly, the revascularization should be performed only after the epidemic controlled.</text>

      <text>On admission, abnormalities on chest radiographs were seen in all patients (fig 1); 113 (100%) deceased patients and 152 (94%) recovered patients had bilateral involvement on chest radiographs. Typical findings on chest computed tomography images on admission of deceased patients showed bilateral ground glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation (fig 1, A and C), which then progressed rapidly with mass shadows of high density in both lungs (fig 1, B and D). Representative chest computed tomography images of recovered patients showed right middle lobe and lower lobe ground glass opacity and consolidation (fig 1, E and F); then bilateral ground glass opacity and bilateral consolidation of the lungs progressed but right middle lobe consolidation resolved (fig 1, G). Follow-up images showed obviously resolved bilateral ground glass opacity and consolidation (fig 1, H).</text>

      <text>Pulmonary contusion is defined as alveolar consolidation or GGO, which is similar to CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia (Figure 2). It may develop in accidental injuries such as traffic accidents, falls, bumps, and crushes, and is characterized by parenchymal hemorrhage, interstitial edema, and alveolar collapse, which potentially lead to compromised respiratory function. The pathological changes of pulmonary contusion are mainly damage to lung parenchymal cells, alveolar and capillary bleeding, pulmonary interstitial edema, atelectasis, and pulmonary consolidation. Pulmonary contusion generally begins with mild interstitial edema after injury; interstitial hemorrhage occurs after 1-2 h, and becomes apparent after 4 h, subsequently with exudation of monocytes and neutrophils. Protein, red blood cells, and many inflammatory cells appear in the alveoli, and the normal alveolar structure begins to disappear. Normally, pulmonary contusion starts to be absorbed within 7-10 d, and could return to normal without leaving any traces. Therefore, according to the amount of alveolar hemorrhage, chest CT of pulmonary contusions can appear as patchy or disseminated GGO because of a large volume of alveolar blood and/or consolidation as a result of a large volume of blood in the alveoli; the edges are blurred, and the dorsal subpleural distribution is dominant.</text>

      <text>On examination, she was conscious with a body temperature of 38.3°C and her vital signs were stable. Small moist rales were heard in both lungs. Laboratory tests of her blood revealed 4.49 × 106 white blood cells per μL, with increased proportion of neutrophils (78.1%) and decreased proportion of lymphocytes (18.0%). C-reactive protein was elevated to 73.4 mg/L. Chest computed tomography (CT) indicated multifocal ill-defined nodular ground-glass opacities (Figure 1 A, arrow) and patchy consolidations lesions (arrow head) distributed in the middle-lateral zone and subpleural regions. Tests for Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus and coxsackie virus, and influenza A and influenza B viruses were all negative, while quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the patient's sputum tested positive for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid.</text>

      <text>From 25 January onward, the patient’s syndromes had gradually resolved with only occasional dry cough. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the lungs was performed on 25th, 29th January and 12th February (Fig. 1). Evidence of severe pneumonia, including multiple lesions and swollen lymph nodes, could be seen from both of the lungs on 25th January. (Fig. 1a) The patient was then given 500 mg lopinavir and ritonavir tablets (Abbott S.P.A., Italy) every 12 h until 6 Feb as a combination treatment for antiviral effect. SARS-COV-2 ribonucleic acid test was negative using nasopharyngeal swabs done by our hospital on 26 January. To confirm the presence of SARS-COV-2, the patient’s BALF sample was sent to Shenzhen CDC for viral nucleic acid detection. SARS-COV-2 ribonucleic acid was tested positive for BALF sample on 27 January. Oxygen supplement by non-invasive BIPAP was replaced by high-flow humidification oxygen therapy instrument for higher oxygen flow of 45 L/min and oxygen concentration of 40% on 28 January. Biochemical test results indicated an increased level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) since 29 January. The patient was diagnosed to have toxipathic hepatitis which was possibly induced by SARS-COV-2. The patient then received 50 mg compound glycyrrhizin tablets (Akiyama Jozai Co., Ltd., Japan) three times per day from 29 January to 13 February and 50 mg bicyclol tablets (Beijing Union Pharmaceutical Factory, China) three times per day from 31 January to 13 February for liver protection. (Figure 2) ALT level resumed to the normal range on 13 February. To prevent pulmonary fibrosis, the patient was given 7-day course of 0.2 g acetylcysteine granules (Bio Pharmacceutical, China) three times per day from 7 February. Obvious improvements could be seen from the subsequent CT scanning results of the lungs on 29th January (Fig. 1b) and 12 February (Fig. 1c). Oxygen supplement by high-flow humidification oxygen therapy instrument was discontinued on 31 January and the patient was given nasal catheter for oxygen inhalation with a flow rate of 4 L/min. His clinical conditions was stable with fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) value fluctuating within the normal range. (Table 1) On 2 February, the patient stated that there was obvious improvement of his symptoms. CT scanning of the lungs (Fig. 1c) on 12 February confirmed the improvement and the patient was discharged on the following day. </text>

      <text>Our index case—Case 1 (66-year old man from Wuhan, China) —presented on January 22, 2020 with a 2-day history of fever (38.1°C) and cough (Figure 1 A). Chest radiograph showed bilateral, patchy, ill-defined lung infiltrates (Figure 1B). Throat swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. He progressively became more dependent on supplemental oxygen (Figure 1A), with worsening lung infiltrates on chest radiograph. His respiratory function reached a nadir on day 5 post illness onset, as evidenced by the oxygen saturation (Figure 1C) and tachycardia (Figure 1D) despite 4L of supplemental oxygen. He was initiated on oral lopinavir-ritonavir on the same day. After the first two positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR findings, subsequent throat swabs from Case 1 were only positive intermittently until day 18 of illness (Figure 1A).</text>

      <text>Case 2 (37 years old) was the son of Case 1. On January 23, he reported mild sore throat and cough that started 3 days earlier, even before onset of symptoms in the index case (Figure 1A). He also reported a one-day history of diarrhea on January 18. He was never febrile throughout this period. Chest radiographs were normal (Figure 1B). Nonetheless, throat swabs were consistently RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Case 2 until day 29 from illness onset (Figure 1A).</text>

      <text>Case 3 was a 38-year-old businessman from Wuhan, China. He arrived in Singapore on January 22 and became unwell with fever, non-productive cough, lethargy, and myalgia a day later. He presented to the hospital on January 29 for persistent fever and was diagnosed with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19. He did not develop lower respiratory tract complications, but throat swabs were consistently RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 until 23 days post illness onset (Figure 1A). Chest radiograph was normal (Figure 1B).</text>

      <text>Analysis of RNA extracted from whole blood revealed a highly dynamic pro-inflammatory response in Case 1. Expression of pro-inflammatory genes in Case 1 (Figure 2 A), represented by cluster 4 and consisting of mostly genes driving the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and inflammatory response as well as cytokine signaling pathways (Figure S1), was notably higher than in healthy controls (Table S1). Expression of most of these genes peaked on day 6 of illness. This peak in pro-inflammatory gene expression thus lagged behind the nadir of respiratory function on day 5 of illness (Figures 1C and 1D). Indeed, cytokines such as IL2, IL6, TNF, and IFNA1/13 were either expressed within the range of healthy controls or were induced only after respiratory function nadir (Figure S1F). Only expression of the cytokines IL1A and IL1B preceded the nadir of respiratory function (Figure 2B). Correspondingly, expression of IL1 receptor (Figure 2B) and the associated downstream signaling molecules (Figure S1E) was also induced before respiratory function nadir. These findings, albeit from a single subject, raise the possibility that global cytokine expression is not the cause of compromised respiratory function in COVID-19 patients. Instead, the finding of increased expression of IL1 and its associated signaling pathway suggests that COVID-19 pathogenesis may be driven by this pathway. If this is proven correct, licensed IL1 or IL1 receptor antagonists—such as canakinumab and anakinra, respectively—could potentially be repurposed to treat COVID-19 patients to prevent respiratory dysfunction.</text>

      <text>A 61-year-old male smoker was admitted to our hospital for surgical treatment of a lung adenocarcinoma, diagnosed on biopsy. His clinical history was positive for a MALT lymphoma diagnosed 6 months before, with complete remission after therapy. According to pre-operatory imaging, obtained 3 weeks before surgery, the lesion was localized in the right inferior lobe, measured 2 cm and showed a solid appearance. There were no ground glass opacities. At admission, the patient was in good general condition, afebrile. A thoracoscopic lobectomy with lymph node dissection (stations 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10) was performed, without intraoperative complications. After surgery, the patient developed progressive lymphopenia (with values ranging between 920 and 340 lymphocytes/μL from the first to the fifth post-operative day) and, on the scheduled date for discharge, had an episode of fever (38 °C) in the absence of respiratory symptoms. Thus, his antibiotic therapy was changed, with no improvement. A pharyngeal swab PCR test was performed, which confirmed the suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient was immediately transferred to the isolation ward where he developed cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and high fever (38–39 °C). SpO2 was stable between 96 and 98%. Both white blood cells (2570/μL) and lymphocytes counts were low (280/μL). A chest CT scan showed post-resection changes and bilateral, peripheral, and ill-defined ground-glass opacities, mainly involving the lower lobe, consistent with Covid-19 pneumonia (Fig. 1a).</text>

      <text>Since oxygen saturation had dropped to 35%, he received supplemental oxygen through a CPAP mask. On a second CT scan, performed 1 week later, the ground-glass opacities were enlarged, with areas of consolidation (Fig. 1b). He received a therapy based on antibiotics (meropenem and bactrim), antiviral drugs (acyclovir and darunavir), and on two recently approved experimental drugs for SARS-CoV-2 infection: tocilizumab (commonly used for the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis) and chloroquine hydrate (a common antimalarial drug), with an improvement of his conditions and clinical remission in the following weeks.</text>

      <text>In this short communication, we presented our original CXR scoring system for grading the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. This scoring system is designed exclusively for a semi-quantitative assessment of the severity and progression of pulmonary involvement in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (Fig. 3). It is quite simple and can be easily replicated in other clinical settings.</text>

      <text>On Jan 24, 2020(DOI 11), the patient was still suffering from diarrhea and intermittent fever (highest fever, 38.5°C). No remarkable abnormity was found in her stool examination and her admission blood culture was negative. Her condition began to deteriorate at noon, when she reported intermittent cough accompanied by chest pain with the blood pressure dropped to 96/54mmHg. Based on her new symptoms, the patient underwent abdominal and chest CT immediately. Imaging revealed newly developed evidence of lung lesions (Figure 2 ), while abdominal CT scans showed nothing noteworthy. Blood examinations revealed a progressive decrease in white blood cell counts and lymphocyte counts (white blood cell count 2.4 × 109/L, lymphocyte count 0.5 × 109/L, absolute neutrophil count 1.7 × 109/L). To raise leukocyte count, the patient was medicated with subcutaneous injection of 300ug human granulocyte stimulating factor (GSF) and GSF was discontinued 4 days later. The patient's blood pressure remained low despite adequate volume resuscitation (central venous pressure:6-10cmH20) until low dose vasopressors (dopamine) infused.</text>

      <text>The patient was afebrile, 1 day after initiating methylprednisolone therapy, but her dyspnea aggravated, with persistent diarrhea. Despite the administration of systematic corticosteroid and IVIG, the patient's PO2/FiO2 decreased to 150mmHg on DOI 13, suggesting that she had progressed to acute severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. Laboratory data revealed progressive depletion of lymphocytes (lymphocyte count, 0.3 × 109/L). In addition, there appeared notable elevation of the serum enzymes and creatine (Table 1). CT scans showed bilateral multiple patchy ground-glass opacities and high-density consolidation, which revealed rapidly progressive pulmonary lesions (Fig 2). Nasal high-flow oxygen therapy was commenced. Furthermore, we initiated the administration of three consecutive sessions of PE with 6000ml plasma (frozen plasma served as the sole replacement solution) followed by 20g IVIG from DOI 14 to DOI 17. The patient's symptoms were almost all relieved, after three consecutive sessions of PE treatment. No adverse events or complications were observed during PE treatment. The oxygenation index increased with oxygen saturation of 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air oxygen and the blood pressure restored and maintained on Jan 29, 2020(DOI 16). Vasopressor therapy and antibiotic treatment were discontinued. Simultaneously, levels of enzymes and creatinine recovered. Although the clinical condition was improved, episodes of diarrheal persisted (frequency: 6-7 times, water lost: 700-1000ml, per day) on DOI16. Stool cultures finalized with no growth and the patient was prescribed with anisodamine (10 mg, daily) intravenously.</text>

      <text>On February 6, 2020, a patient presented to the emergency department with headache followed by a loss of consciousness at a local hospital in Guangzhou. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage and left frontal lobe hematoma (Figure 2A ). The patient was then transferred to our facility for neurosurgical consultation and treatment. Upon arrival, the patient was unconscious, body temperature 38.9°C (102°F), pulse 61 bpm, respiratory rate 17 bpm, and blood pressure 179/120 mm Hg. Neurologic examination showed bilateral pupil diameter 2.5 mm, sluggish pupillary light reflex, nuchal rigidity, extremities withdrawal to pain, bilateral positive Babinski sign. Glasgow Coma Scale was 5 points, Hunt &amp; Hess was grade 4, Modified Fisher's Scale was grade 4, and World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grading system score was grade 5. Medical history was unremarkable, with no hypertension or diabetes mellitus. There was no family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient had a history of traveling to Hubei province, where COVID-19 started and became the epicenter in China. The patient's family stated that the patient returned from Hubei province 12 days ago and started having a fever the day of presentation to the emergency department. Given the travel history and high body temperature, we suspected that the patient contracted the SARS-Cov-2 virus during the trip to Hubei province.</text>

      <text>The COVID-19 task force of our hospital was consulted, and a suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 was made. Specimens were collected for testing. A nasopharyngeal swab sample was sent for reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2 virus. CT angiography of the head (Figure 2B and C) and thoracic CT were obtained, with all health care personnel in enhanced PPE. CT angiography of the head revealed an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Thoracic CT showed bilateral lower lobe inflammatory changes and suspected right upper-lobe exudative change (Figure 3A ). Definitive aneurysm repair procedure was deemed necessary and urgent by the neurosurgery team; the COVID-19 emergency surgery protocol was then activated. A negative-pressure OR was requested, and the anesthesiology team was informed of the situation and the planned surgical treatment. An isolation room was reserved for the patient for immediate postoperative care. The patient was transitioned to the OR through the designated route. All participating health care personnel was wearing enhanced PPE, as mentioned previously (Figure 4 ). The patient underwent a modified pterional craniotomy for hematoma evacuation with anterior communicating artery aneurysm clipping, and placement of intracranial pressure monitor.</text>

However, due to the high false-negative rate (30%) of the testing and the patient's symptoms and CT findings, a decision was made by the COVID-19 task force to treat the patient as a patient under investigation for 14 days. The patient did well and eventually was discharged home at 14 days postoperatively with intact neurologic function. Two-month postoperative CT of the head (Figure 2D) was obtained, which showed resolved hematoma, stable aneurysm clip, and no hydrocephalus. A thoracic CT also was obtained and showed improvement from previous hospital admission images (Figure 3B).</text>

      <text>Of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients confirmed by laboratory diagnosis. The time from the date of onset to the date of conjunctival sampling was 18.15 [7.57] days on average, ranging from 6 to 46 days. Only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis were identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 was found in ocular discharges by RT-PCR in only one patient. Briefly, a 29-year-old nurse working in the Emergency Department at Tongji hospital, Wuhan City, China was referred to the Department of Ophthalmology at Tongji Hospital on February 1st, 2020 due to excessive tearing and redness in both eyes. No other systemic symptoms were reported except for a moderate fever of 38.2 °C on January 31st, 2020. An ocular examination revealed conjunctival congestion and watery discharges in both eyes with normal best corrected visual acuity, normal corneal epithelium, quiescent anterior chamber, and no tenderness or enlargement of the preauricular lymph node (Fig. 1 A). We therefore excluded the possibility of conventional conjunctivitis, such as bacterial conjunctivitis, hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, according to her clinical symptoms and signs. The patient clarified that she continuously wore medical N95 respirator while working in the Emergency Department, but occasionally worked with a dislocated eye goggles touching her eyelids. Considering the occupational exposure by SARS-CoV-2, the related assay was arranged. Surprisingly, the chest CT showed multiple peripheral ground-glass opacities in both lungs (Fig. 1D). The conjunctival and oropharyngeal swabs tested for SARS-CoV-2 were both positive. The blood Rt showed initially normal lymphocyte count, followed with progressive lymphocytopenia. On the basis of her epidemiologic characteristics, clinical manifestations, chest images, and laboratory findings, this patient was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infected acute viral conjunctivitis and pneumonia.</text>

      <text>The patient reported a 4-day history of persistent conjunctivitis and a 3-day history of fever from onset. Ganciclovir eye drops was used to treat her conjunctivitis on day 2 during home quarantine and she got cough from day 4–9 post of illness. Although the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays for both the nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swab were negative at day 10 post illness, a fever reappeared, and the chest CT showed that her pneumonia aggravated (Fig. 1E). She was transferred to the hospital, treated according to the guidance of CDC, and then discharged 11 days post hospitalization, accompanied with a slight cough, normal body temperature, normal conjunctival appearance, and regression of pulmonary lesions (Fig. 1 C and 1F).</text>

A few infiltrates (slight slice-like shadow with increased density) in the lower lobe of the right lung were seen. (B) Day 3 after illness onset for Patient Index. In the peripheral zones of both lungs, scattered ground-glass opacities with fuzzy edges were seen, suggesting bilateral pneumonia with highly likely viral nature. (C) Day 2 after illness onset for Patient 3. A few infiltrates and ground-glass opacities were detected in the lower lobe of left lung. (D) Day 3 after illness onset for Patient 4. Ground-glass opacities and infiltrates in the right lung were observed. (E) Day 2 after illness onset for Patient 7.

He took the high-speed-rail leaving Wuhan in the morning on January 19, 2020, four days before the “lockdown” of Wuhan, and arrived at his hometown in Feidong in the afternoon for the China Spring-Festival (Fig. 1). In the evening on January 19, he went to visit (talk and have supper with) his cousin, a 16-year-old otherwise-healthy female (Patient-2) and his uncle (Contact-1; later excluded from infection), in their apartment for about 0.5 hours without air-conditioning or wearing a mask. Further exposure and contact details are shown in Supplementary results and Table S1.</text>

      <text>Patient-Index reported that the very first symptom that he experienced was itchy eyes at noon on January 22 (Fig. S1). In the afternoon, he felt dizzy with a fever of 37.5°C developed (measured by himself), and he (starting to wear a mask) attended a local outpatient-clinic in Feidong and was prescribed amoxicillin capsules, paracetamol and amantadine compound capsules, and ambroxol dispersible-tablets, after taking which his temperature returned to normal (36.5°C). On the same day, he also developed mild nasal-congestion and rhinorrhea, both lasting 2 days. On January 23, his body temperature was normal in the morning but rose again to 37.5°C at noon, which was again temporarily controlled by the drugs; however, in the evening he had fever again. On the same day before the onset of fever, Patient-2 went to visit Patient-Index, and brought him some home-made food. They ate and chatted together in his room which was tightly confined with no doors or windows open and without air-conditioning for about 0.5 h. Patient-2 later became infected. Having learned about the COVID-19 emergence in Wuhan and the possible human-to-human-transmission from Internet at noon on January 22, he decided to go to Hospital-1 for further assessment and management in the evening on January 23. Virus-RNA detection using respiratory-samples taken on January 26 and 27 both revealed positive results on rRT-PCR assays, confirming the SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 1). Assays to detect other pathogens were all negative. Further descriptions of the disease-course and management of Patient-Index are detailed in Supplementary results.</text>

      <text>On admission, abnormalities in chest-CT-images suggesting viral-pneumonia were detected in six (all males; 22–23 years) of the eight youngsters confirmed with COVID-19 (Table 2; Fig. 1). None of the conditions were severe. Of the six pneumonia-patients, five had unilateral-involvement, and Patient-8 had bilateral-pneumonia on admission; four had involvement of the lower-lobe, and the other two of the middle-lobe. Of the five patients with unilateral-disease, pneumonia was located in the right-lung in four patients, and in the left-lung in Patient-3. The typical-findings on chest-CT-scan, multifocal-mottling, patchy-shadows, and/or ground-glass-opacities, which were mostly around the peripheral-parts of the lungs and which were compatible with abnormalities seen in viral-pneumonia, were detected in the pneumonia-patients on admission. Patient-Index's pneumonia progressed to bilateral-pneumonia two days after the initial scan. For the youngest patient (Patient-2; 16 years), while no abnormalities were detected the next day after illness-onset, a few infiltrates were noticed in the lower-lob of left-lung six days later.</text>

      <text>A 31-year old lady with a history of cystinuria presented to a UK hospital with isolated right loin pain. No respiratory symptoms, fever, or signs of sepsis were noted. She was assessed as a nonsuspected COVID-19 case and a noncontrast CT kidney, ureter, bladder (KUB) was arranged. The CT identified a distal 10 × 6 mm right ureteric stone causing hydronephrosis (Fig. 1 A). At the base of her right lung, numerous foci of ground-glass appearances were noted, suggestive of COVID-19 (Fig. 1B). She was isolated on a COVID-19 ward and a ureteric stent was inserted under spinal anesthesia the following day with full personal protective equipment (PPE). Ureteroscopy and stone fragmentation was not undertaken to reduce operative time, whilst spinal anesthesia avoided the need for ventilation with its attendant risks of respiratory compromise and aerosol generation. She was discharged the same evening with a plan for definitive stone surgery in several weeks' time. A subsequent nasopharyngeal swab test was positive for COVID-19 and she was instructed to self-isolate.</text>

      <text>A patient in his fifties without any past medical history consulted his general practitioner, in the Marseille area on March 6th, 2020, because of fever, headache and cough evolving since February 29th. He had been sent by his company (company X) to the Central Africa Republic (CAR) from February 13th to February 25th where he gave presentations (training in management) for 6 days, to a public of about 30 resource directors of several CAR ministries. Because of persistence of fever and cough at day 9-post onset, he was referred to the emergency unit of a local hospital on March 9th. On clinical examination he had fever (40 °C) and dyspnea with oxygen saturation at 91% in ambient air. Pulmonary auscultation revealed bilateral basal crackling sounds. Malaria was ruled-out by blood smear microscopic examination and influenza was ruled-out by PCR on nasal swab fluid. C-reactive protein was at 103 mg/L and white blood cell count was at 8.8 Giga/L. Naso-pharyngeal swab fluid was tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR as previously described and resulted positive. The patient was immediately transferred to our center (IHU Méditerranée Infection) for hospitalization in a highly contagious patient section. A Chest CT-scan showed bilateral interstitial pulmonary infiltrates (Fig. 1 ). Progressive aggravation led to his temporary transfer to an intensive care unit for five days, before coming back to our ward where he is still hospitalized at the time of writing. The patient reported that his partner (in her fifties) who works for company X and undertook the same business travel, had cough and fever from February 25th to February 29th that resolved thereafter. She had a negative SARS-Cov-2 RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal sample obtained on March 3rd.</text>

      <text>Blood routine and biochemical data of the patients in Guangzhou were basically normal, and only 25% of the patients had a lymphocyte count of less than 1.0 × 109/L. The lymphocyte count, hemoglobin and albumin of patients in Wuhan were significantly lower, while inflammatory biomarkers, blood erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), CRP and PCT were significantly higher than those in Guangzhou (all P values &lt; 0.05). Chest CT scan indicated bilateral involvement in both cities. Based on Guangzhou data, the main manifestations were multiple patches (90%), ground-glass opacity (80%) and interstitial lesions (80%). Invasive lesions were presented in 55% of patients (Fig. 1 ). Multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity were more common in Guangzhou patients (14% vs 60%, P &lt; 0.001) (Table 2 ).</text>

      <text>By day 16, body temperature of this patient had retained normal for 9 days, and she complained no symptoms. RT-PCR examination for SARS-CoV-2 was performed on day 10, 11 and 14, and all 3 tests were negative. The patient was then discharged from hospital and was instructed to receive a quarantine at home. However, on day 24, the patient felt chest pain and had cough and sputum production. Her symptom was not relieved on day 25, so her nasal swab was obtained and the test for SARS-CoV-2 was positive again. The patient was admitted to our centre on day 26. Chest CT scan on day 26 showed absorption on lung disease (Fig. 1D). The observation of the patients is still ongoing. Family member of this patient has been ruled out from infection.</text>

      <text>A 50-year-old male with a history of 6-year hypertension and diabetes was admitted to our hospital with a 9-day fever and cough. His body temperature reached the highest of 38.5°C. The laboratory examinations showed a lower degree of lymphocyte percentage and increased levels of C-reactive Protein (CRP) and fibrinogen, also with prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. On admission, nasopharyngeal swab specimens from the upper respiratory tract were timely obtained and he was confirmed with COVID-19 when the RT-PCR tests of the specimens for presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA (DAAN GEEN co. LTD of Sun Yat-sen University) were positive on illness day 13. After a period of symptomatic and antiviral treatments including ganciclovir (250 mg, iv drip qd) and ribavirin (500 mg, iv drip bid), he met the Chinese Guideline criteria for hospital discharge (absence of clinical symptoms, substantially improved acute exudative lesions on chest computed tomography (CT) images and two consecutively negative RT-PCR test results separated by at least one day) on illness day 20. After hospital discharge, the patient was asked to continue the quarantine protocol at home for at least two weeks. However, similar to what has been reported recently, this patient had two re-positive RT-PCR test results again on illness day 34 and illness day 38 (post-discharge re-testing was a policy of the Chinese Government). He was thus re-hospitalized. This time he was asymptomatic and his chest CT scans showed improvement of original lesion with a few ground-glass opacities (Figure 1 ). We ran viral antibody tests on illness day 40 and got positive results too (INNOVITA Biotechnology Company, Chengdu precision medicine industrial technology research institute co. LTD of west China). The positive results of both IgM/IgG from this patient helped us to confirm the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. He has been given further therapies like Chinese herbal medicines to enhance his immunity until the RT-PCR result from nasopharyngeal swabs becomes consecutively negative twice at the time of discharge.</text>

On admission (illness day 3), the patient reported that she had no shortness of breath, nausea or diarrhea. Oropharyngeal swab and sputum specimens were positive for COVID-19 (SARS CoV-2) by real-time reverse transcription–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays with primers and probes targeting the E genes of SARS CoV-2. She received lopinavir (200 mg)/ritonavir (50 mg) (LPV/r) as two pills twice daily since illness day 5. On illness day 6–8, episodes of vomiting and severe watery diarrhea developed which was consistent with the side effects of LPV/r, and LPV/r was discontinued on illness day 8. The tests of SARS CoV-2 remained positive until illness day 23. On illness day 28, a chest CT was performed (Fig. 1 , Panel A) and the patient, who was afebrile, was discharged.</text>

      <text>On admission, 11 patients (P1–P11) underwent high resolution chest CT examination and their manifestations were shown in (Table 2 ). P1 (Fig. 1, F0, A1–A4): CT images showed patchy-like pure ground glass opacity (GGO) involving subpleural regions of the right middle lobe (Fig. 1, F0, A3, arrow) and the right lower lobe. The slightly thickened interlobular septa within the lesion makes it appear the crazy paving sign (Fig. 1, F0, A2, arrowhead). P2 (Fig. 2, P2, A1-A2): CT images showed mixed GGO and consolidation that appeared at subpleural area of the right middle lobe and the right lower lobe. The lesion presented as patchy-like morphology. P3 (Fig. 2, P3, A1-A2): CT images showed two well circumscribed, round nodular-like GGO lesions (Fig. 2, P3, arrow) located in the central area of the left upper lobe. P4 (Fig. 2, P4): CT images showed a small nodular-like pure GGO (Fig. 2, P4, arrow) located in the central area of the left lower lobe. P5 (Fig. 2, P5): CT images showed a slight of irregular pure GGO (Fig. 2, P5, arrow) located in the subpleural region of the right lower lobe. P6 (Fig. 2, P6, A1-A2): CT images showed bilateral multi-focal mixed GGO and consolidation appeared at subpleural area of lung. Mild bronchiectasis (Fig. 2, P6, A2, arrow) can also be observed within the lesion. P7 (Fig. 2, P7, A1–A4): CT images showed bilateral subpleural lesions, among which the lesion in the left lower lobe was nodular-like with pseudocavitary sign (Fig. 2, P7, A3, arrow). P8 (Fig. 3, P8) and P9 (Fig. 3, P9): CT images showed bilateral subpleural lesions with crazy paving sign. P10 (Fig. 3, P10, A1-A2): CT images showed bilateral multiple lesions, some of them were pure GGO located in the central region of the lung. P11 (Fig. 3, P11, A1-A2): CT images showed bilateral subpleural small nodular-like lesions.</text>

      <text>In late December of 2019, a new coronavirus was discovered in China. On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization named the disease caused by this virus COVID-19. The disease quickly spread to Chinese cities and other parts of the world, including Thailand, Japan, Taiwan and Iran. The number of infected patients increased daily until the World Health Organization in June declared the outbreak a serious and urgent threat to public health. Most people infected with the virus recover well, but some also may experience fatal complications, such as acute organ failure, septic shock, acute pulmonary edema, acute pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. As infection has been transmitted from individual to individual, the first cases of the disease in areas outside of Wuhan, occurred in travelers from Wuhan; as The First Case of COVID-19 was confirmed to be a 35-year-old woman living in Wuhan who traveled to Korea. On January 20, 2020, a 55-year-old woman working in Wuhan, arrived at Taiwan and was referred to quarantine authorities with symptoms of sore throat, dry cough, fatigue, and feeling low-grade fever on January 11. While COVID-19 infection seems to be more prevalent in adults than in children, rare cases of children infection are being reported, mainly seen in family clusters. The presented case is a 75-day-old infant that was referred to the pediatric emergency department, with a history of severe dry cough and abnormal noisy breathing sound (heard without a stethoscope) during the last 11 days. The patient had been suffering from fever since about 7 days ago; the fever was having a good response to antipyretic. But mother had not been using a thermometer for screening the fever. About three days ago coughs got more severe, along with an increased breathing sound and dyspnea appeared. On arrival, the infant had a respiratory rate of 50 per minute, a temperature of 37.6 centigrade, Pulse Rate of 172 and O2 saturation of 85%. In physical examination, an intercostal retraction was seen and lung auscultation revealed diminished wheeze and ralse in both sides. After taking oxygen with the hood, the O2 saturation got increased to 97% and intercostal retraction disappeared. Therefore, respiratory rate reduced to 35 times per minute. A normal complete blood count and levels of Na+ and K+ were reported upon the patient's arrival. The High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the patient after two hours of patient arrival is shown in Fig. 1 , which shows bilateral peripheral consolidation with a ground glass view. While, as reviewed in Cao et al. study, most studies have reported the infection to be more severe in adults rather than the child, the dissemination of COVID-19 in children implies that it has high transmitting potential in a specific transmission dynamics. Pediatricians have to know more about the epidemiological and clinical aspects of the disease to diagnose and control COVID-19.</text>

      <text>A 9-year-old male patient was hospitalized due to having had a fever for three days. The child had no obvious inducement of fever three days before this. His temperature was as high as 38.9 °C, and he presented no chill or shivering, cough, sputum or sore throat, chest tightness or chest pain, acid reflux, nausea, abdominal pain or diarrhea, dizziness or headaches, or breathing cyanosis, and no weakness or muscle ache. The patient had lived in Wuhan for a long time. There was also no clear history of exposure to patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. He was in good health and denied a history of food and drug allergies. Routine blood examination in the external hospital showed: leukocyte 13.07 × 109/L, erythrocyte 4.25 × 1012/L, neutrophil ratio 72.71%, lymphocyte ratio 16.12%, absolute value of lymphocyte 2.1 × 109/L, influenza A and B pathogen detection were negative. A chest X-ray did not find any obvious abnormality in either lung. The patient was given "oral administration of cattilan and intravenous drip of lysine acetylsalicylate injection" for one day (the specific dosage is unknown), and no fever occurred. The child was sent to hospital by his parents for further diagnosis and treatment. Because the child had lived in Wuhan two weeks before the onset of the disease and had a fever, SARS-CoV-2 infection was not excluded. During patient admission examination: T 36.6 °C, P 100 times/min, R 20 times/min, BP 100/65 mmHg, no congestion in the pharynx, no swelling of the tonsils, clear breath sounds in either lung, and no obvious dry and wet rales were recorded. Routine blood examination after admission was conducted with the following results: white blood cell 4.22 × 109/L, red blood cell 3.80 × 1012/L, hemoglobin 118.00 g/L, platelet 363.00 × 109/L, neutrophil percentage 37.40%, lymphocyte percentage 53.80%. Novel coronavirus nucleic acids testing was positive. Results for biochemical examination are: lactate dehydrogenase 69U/L↑, α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 258U/L↑, creatine kinase 139U/L, creatine kinase isoenzyme 41U/L, C- reactive protein 15.2 mg/L↑, serum amyloid &gt;300 mg/L↑, procalcitonin 0.28 ng/mL (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 ).</text>

      <text>A 40-year-old man with no medical history presented with 5 days of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea on exertion. On examination, he was febrile to 39.4°C (102.9°F), in moderate respiratory distress, and had oxyhemoglobin desaturation. COVID-19 was confirmed by a positive PCR test result obtained via a nasopharyngeal swab, and he was started on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Over the next 2 days, he continued to develop worsening hypoxemia, bilateral chest infiltrates (Fig 1 ), and accessory muscle fatigue requiring intubation and transfer to the medical ICU. There, he was diagnosed with ARDS and treated with low tidal volume ventilation, prone positioning, and a bumetanide drip. On day 4 of admission (9 days after symptom onset), he developed septic shock and was started on a norepinephrine drip. Given this decompensation and increasing inflammatory markers (Table 1 ), he was treated with a dose of tocilizumab (400 mg IV). The next day the patient developed ST segment depression in leads V4-V6 on ECG and increased troponin levels, which peaked at 30.39 ng/mL. ECG revealed mild global hypokinesis, and a diagnosis of viral myocarditis was made. Swan-Ganz catheter measurements confirmed a reduced cardiac index. The next day the patient developed a fever of 109°F and indexes of septic shock (normal cardiac index and reduced systemic vascular resistance) refractory to four vasopressor agents and passed away. Repeat laboratory measures (Table 1) suggested the development of sHLH (cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase, hypofibrinogenemia). This decompensation occurred despite a decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) after tocilizumab therapy.</text>

      <text>A 69-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and aplastic anemia presented with 6 days of productive cough, pleuritic chest pain, fever, fatigue, and abdominal pain. On examination, she was febrile to 100.5°F, not in any respiratory distress, and her oxyhemoglobin saturation was 96% on room air. A CT scan revealed diffuse bilateral nodular opacities (Fig 1). COVID-19 was confirmed by a positive PCR test result obtained via a nasopharyngeal swab and she was started on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. On hospital day 2 (7 days after symptom onset), she rapidly progressed into acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and septic shock. She was intubated, started on norepinephrine, and treated with a dose of tocilizumab (560 mg IV). On day 3, her shock worsened, requiring the maximum dose of three vasopressor agents, and she was started on stress dose steroids. Concurrently, she went into acute kidney injury requiring continuous venovenous hemodialysis. On day 4 (9 days after symptom onset), her inflammatory markers continued to increase (Table 2 ) and she was treated with a second dose of tocilizumab (700 mg IV). Despite the second dose, her clinical status worsened as she developed sHLH (cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase, hypofibrinogenemia) and passed away. As in case 1, these developments occurred despite a decrease in CRP after tocilizumab therapy.</text>

      <text>The results suggested that 89.8% (44/49) of patients had a typical transition from early stage to advanced stage and advanced stage to dissipating stage (Fig. 1 ), 42.9% (21/49) of patients with the evidence fibrosis in follow CT examination whereas 57.1% (28/49) of patients without the definite fibrosis. The age of patients with fibrosis in follow CT was older than that of those who without fibrosis (mean age, 45.4 vs. 33.8 years, P &lt; 0.05), the LOS of patients with fibrosis was longer than that of patients without fibrosis (19.1 vs. 15.0 days, P &lt; 0.05), and percentage of patients with fibrosis in ICU was higher than that of those who without fibrosis (19.0% vs. 3.6%, P = 0.08). That is to say, Patients with fibrosis in follow CT were older, with longer LOS, higher rate of ICU admission than that of those who without fibrosis.</text>

      <text>Chest CT images were normal in five patients (31.3 %). Abnormalities identified in the other 11 (68.8 %) involved one lobe (8/16, 50%) or two (3/16, 18.8 %), appearing as nodular (5/16, 31.3 %) or small/patchy (6 cases, 37.5 %) changes. One patient (6.3 %) displayed consolidation, two (12.5 %) had visible air bronchograms, and two (12.5 %) exhibited lesions distributed along bronchovascular bundles, similar to bronchopneumonia. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) were present in seven patients (43.8 %), without paving-stone pattern; halo signs appeared in four patients (25 %); and lymphadenopathy was encountered in one patient (6.2 %) (Typical cases with Figs. 1 and 2, Figs. 1 and 2, Figs. 3 and 4, Figs. 3 and 4, Fig. 5 ).</text>

      <text>A 66-year-old woman with a past medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary fibrosis, and asthma, on chronic methotrexate and oral and inhaled steroids, presented on March 16, 2020 with fever and cough after a 2-week course of sinus and upper respiratory tract symptoms initially treated with doxycycline, followed by levofloxacin as an outpatient. Owing to lack of improvement, she presented to the emergency room and was found to be hypoxic. Computed tomography showed widespread ground-glass opacities as well as honeycombing of the right lung (Figure 1 ). COVID-19 was suspected and testing was eventually positive. Within 48 hours she developed profound respiratory failure and required intubation. She also required adrenergic support with norepinephrine. She was started on intravenous azithromycin on March 18. The decision was made to start hydroxychloroquine on March 21; however, it was stopped after 1 dose owing to a QTc of 620 ms with a notched broad T wave (Figure 2A ). No ventricular ectopy was present. Serum potassium and magnesium were 4.4 mM and 2.9 mg/dL, respectively. Electrophysiology consultation recommended 100 mg intravenous lidocaine followed by a repeat 12-lead electrocardiogram. This revealed a shortening of the QTc to 550 ms (Figure 2B). It was recommended to restart hydroxychloroquine and begin a lidocaine infusion. The patient was able to complete the course of hydroxychloroquine without an arrhythmic event. Despite receiving a full course of hydroxychloroquine, she remained ventilator dependent and died owing to progressive metabolic acidosis and multiorgan system failure on March 25. By the time hydroxychloroquine was first initiated, she had already been intubated for 72 hours and was in severe respiratory failure. Owing to several similar consults in COVID-19 patients with borderline or increased QTc intervals, we developed a flow chart that addresses QT interval management in order to help clinicians taking care of COVID-19 patients who require chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin (Figure 3 ).</text>

      <text>There are many similar articles about CT findings on pandemic of COVID-19 infection which are written by experienced authors from China, Italy, UK, and Canada in the literature. The first confirmed COVID-19 case in Turkey was detected on 10th of March 2020. Our knowledge and experiences about COVID-19 have been rising from the day that the first case was declared. According to our own experience, the predominant CT findings in COVID-19 pneumonia included basically ground-glass opacification, consolidation, bilateral involvement, and peripheral and diffuse distribution (Figures 1–8, from archive of Şule Akçay who is a pulmonary specialist of a tertiary hospital, Başkent University).</text>

      <text>The patient was a 47-year-old man with past medical history notable for type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented to the emergency department with 5 days of shortness of breath, cough, and fevers. He was intubated on arrival given hypoxia and respiratory distress. He was found to test positive for COVID-19 and treated with antibiotics for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. His respiratory status was steadily improving; however, 2 weeks into his intensive care unit (ICU) course, he was noted to have rising leukocytosis, hypotension requiring escalating vasopressor support, and increased abdominal distension with grimacing on palpation of his right lower quadrant. A CT scan was obtained which demonstrated evidence of small bowel ischemia with perforation (Fig. 1). His mesenteric vessels were noted to be widely patent. On CT scan, he was also incidentally noted to have a new right posterior basal segmental pulmonary embolism.</text>

      <text>As shown in Figure 2, the Quantitative Evaluation System of CT for COVID-19 (YT-CT-Lung, YITU Healthcare Technology Co., Ltd., China) was employed as the CT image quantization and analysis tool under supervision of two board-certified radiologists with more than 10 years of experience. The system combined a fully convolutional network with adaptive thresholding and morphological operations for segmentation of lungs and pneumonia lesions. External validation with 383 axial CT images from 206 patients showed a Dice coefficient of 82.08% for COVID-19 pneumonia lesion segmentation (unpublished data from our other study with a focus on the development and validation of the AI system). By thresholding on CT values in the pneumonia lesions, three quantitative features were computed, including the percentages of lesion volume with ranges of -700~-500 Hounsfield units (HU), -500~-200 HU, and -200~60 HU. The three AI-derived CT features corresponded to percentages of ground glass opacity (GGO) volume (PGV), semi-consolidation volume (PSV), and consolidation volume (PCV), where semi-consolidation was defined as the area of intermediate homogeneous increase in density.</text>

      <text>An example of the differences in CT manifestations between the severe and non-severe groups is presented in Figure 3 displaying CT images of two male patients, who were under 40 years old. One patient developed severe illness, while the other did not, and got discharged meeting the following discharge criteria: two consecutive negative COVID-19 nucleic acid detections at least 24 h apart, afebrile for more than 3 days, and respiratory symptoms significantly relieved. The average PGV, PSV and PCV in the non-severe patients decreased from 1.4, 1.3 and 0.5 on day 0 to 1.0, 0.5 and 0.1 on day 4. On the contrary, the average PGV, PSV, and PCV of the patients in the severe group increased from 3.0, 2.7 and 1.1 on day 0 to 8.3, 11.8 and 5.4 on day 4. Detailed changes in the volumes and the percentages were captured by the AI-derived CT features.</text>

      <text>Secondly, in terms of distribution, the upper lung played an important role in risk evaluation for COVID-19 patients. Previous studies reported worse symptoms related to more pulmonary lesions. However, no detailed distribution information was described. Our study of 421 COVID-19 patients suggested an increased pulmonary lesion in bilateral upper lungs were independent risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes, which as far as we know, has not been reported. This finding is of significant clinical implications, not only in providing us a simpler way to identify high risk patients on CT, but also has potential to extend to chest radiographs, where upper lobe consolidations are easy to be perceived.

One sample taken from a 42-year-old unemployed male born in Algeria who had lived in France for many years was positive. His last foreign travel was to Algeria in August 2019. One of his children presented with ILI prior to the onset of his symptoms. His medical history included asthma and type II diabetes mellitus. He presented to the emergency ward on 27 December 2019 with haemoptysis, cough, chest pain, headache and fever, evolving for 4 days. Initial examination was unremarkable and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed bilateral pulmonary ground-glass opacities in the inferior lobes (Fig. 3 ).</text>

      <text>A 54-year-old male presented to our hospital with fever, cough, and dyspnea of 4-day duration. Due to suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 infection, a nasopharyngeal sample was obtained for PCR analysis and a low-dose thoracic computerized tomogram scan (CT) was performed. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit due to oxygenation failure where a lung ultrasonography was performed in close temporal relationship to the chest CT. The results of the chest CT and the lung ultrasonography are presented in Fig. 1. The patient tested positive of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</text>

      <text>Chest CTs of two patients. (A) Chest CT of patient 9 obtained on February 9 (7 dpoi) before CP transfusion (10 dpoi) showed ground-glass opacity with uneven density involving the multilobal segments of both lungs. The heart shadow outline was not clear. The lesion was close to the pleura. (B) CT Image of patient 9 taken on February 15 (13 dpoi) showed the absorption of bilateral ground-glass opacity after CP transfusion. (C) Chest CT of patient 10 was obtained on February 8 (19 dpoi) before CP transfusion (20 dpoi). The brightness of both lungs was diffusely decreased, and multiple shadows of high density in both lungs were observed. (D) Chest CT of patient 10 on February 18 (29 dpoi) showed those lesions improved after CP transfusion.</text>

      <text>According to chest CTs, all patients showed different degrees of absorption of pulmonary lesions after CP transfusion. Representative chest CT images of patient 9 and patient 10 are shown on Fig. 1. Patient 9, a 49-y-old female admitted 1 day postonset of illness (dpoi), showed the most obvious pulmonary image improvement. At 10 dpoi, one dose of 200-mL transfusion of CP was given. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA converted to negative at 12 dpoi. Compared with the result at 7 dpoi, massive infiltration and ground-glass attenuation disappeared on CT image performed at 13 dpoi, accompanied by a much better pulmonary function. Patient 10, a 50-y-old male, was admitted 3 dpoi and was given a 200-mL transfusion of CP at 20 dpoi. His chest CT presented massive infiltration and widespread ground-glass attenuation on admission and started to show a gradual absorption of lung lesions 5 d after CP transfusion. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA became negative at 25 dpoi.</text>

      <text>We compared the incidence of various CT signs in different stages of the disease, drew a CT sign change trend chart, and found that in the early rapid progressive stage, the CT imaging showed diversified primary signs including GGO plus reticular pattern, GGO plus consolidation, and GGO; consolidation was relatively rare. Representative cases are shown in Fig. 4. In the advanced stage, GGO plus reticular pattern sharply increased and was the most prominent sign, GGO and GGO plus consolidation decreased, consolidation showed an increase, and all the repairing signs (subpleural line, bronchus distortion, and fibrotic strips) significantly increased. In the absorption stage, GGO plus consolidation sharply decreased, consolidation and GGO plus reticular pattern decreased, GGO and all the repairing signs remained with repairing signs continued increasing. This change course indicated that in the advanced stage, signs of progression and absorption coexisted; lung abnormalities showed an asynchronous process with parts absorption and parts progressing or involvement expanding.

      <text>In addition, in this cohort, we found 4 cases showed a negative result of the RT-PCR test for COVID-19 nucleic acid at the first CT scan; after several repeated RT-PCR tests, the result finally turned positive (12~18 days after the first CT scan with lung abnormality, 13~26 days after initial symptom onset). We found the CT findings of these 4 patients were similar to the other cases, indicating that CT scan was more sensitive than RT-PCR results; this finding was consistent with some previous reports. A representative case is shown in Fig. 6. This phenomenon is also mentioned in a recent case report. This may be related to the viral load of the lower respiratory tract secretion in patients with a different course of disease, or nonstandard sampling operation for pharyngeal swab, or it may be related to the existence of a certain degree of false-negative rate of the RT-PCR test. This suggested that CT may be more sensitive and detect lesions earlier than the present RT-PCR test for COVID-19 nucleic acid. This also suggested that there may be a proportion of COVID-19 pneumonia patients with negative COVID-19 nucleic acid result when lung abnormalities already existed on CT imaging; the establishment of diagnostic criteria should take these patients into account.</text>

Other non-specific symptoms have also been reported, which included nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, myalgia, poor appetite, and diarrhoea. Fever and cough typically appear concomitantly, followed by shortness of breath and severe fatigue, which appear around day 6–7 and are associated with development of severe bilateral (and occasional unilateral) pneumonia (Figure 4). </text>

One hundred CTPA were performed in 99 patients to investigate the cause of a respiratory re-aggravation or because of a significant increase of D-dimers. Twenty-five (25%) showed pulmonary embolisms (24 men, mean age 62 years old): 9 troncular, 8 lobar, 5 segmental and 3 subsegmental pulmonary embolisms. Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in median 5.5 [2.8; 9.3] days after ICU admission.</text>

      <text>A 50-year-old female outpatient underwent ECG-gated coronary CT angiography for exertional dyspnea and repolarization abnormalities at ECG. On the angiographic phase (a), pulmonary abnormalities were found in the dependent areas of both lower lobes by the radiology resident and immediately investigated by a low-dose thoracic CT in prone position (b). The findings included peripheral ground-glass opacities and fibrous streaks (white arrowheads) in the posterior portion of the lower lobes. While the patient neglected her symptoms in the first place, she admitted a cough, headache for 10 days, and low-grade fever (38 °C) on interrogation. The patient was then sent to the COVID-19 unit, and RT-PCR was positive for SARS-CoV-2</text>

      <text>Figure 1 shows an example of COVID-19 pneumonia incidentally discovered on chest CT. In supplementary material, other cases are provided, including one case of detection during breast MRI (S2–4), all preceding clinical signs and/or microbiological documentation of infection. The CT findings included typical features of COVID-19 pneumonia, such as multiple bilateral areas of ground-glass opacities (GGO) with reticulation or consolidation. A peripheral and posterior predominance was commonly observed, while in one case (S3), GGO were predominantly located in the central parenchyma. Such findings have been described during the ultra-early asymptomatic stage of the disease, 1–2 weeks after exposure, but could also represent improving abnormalities of previously undetected severe findings in asymptomatic patients. The vascular enlargement sign is an additional finding that can help distinguish COVID-19 from viral pneumonia (S3). The cases presented were identified in the early days of the outbreak in Europe. At that time, specific pathways mainly differentiating “COVID” from “non-COVID” patients” were in the process of being implemented in the emergency departments (ED), intensive care units (ICU), and infectious disease departments; however, such measures were not systematically applied in all hospital areas yet. In this regard, specific management was pursued, including the requirement to wear a mask, immediate information of the suspicious imaging findings to the patient and the referring physician, and activation of the RT-PCR test procedure, as well as careful disinfection of the CT suite. All these infection control measures aimed to prevent potential transmission to other individuals, including other patients who are potentially vulnerable, radiology staff, relatives, and any other personal contacts.</text>

      <text>A 75-year-old man with history of dilated cardiomyopathy, status post PPM implantation 12 years before, was admitted for heart failure exacerbation. His symptoms improved after appropriate treatment with i.v. diuretics. He tested negative for COVID-19 infection. Because of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction despite optimal medical therapy, he underwent device upgrade to an ICD. During the procedure he developed an intense vagal reaction with drop in BP to 60/40 mmHg with presyncope and diaphoresis, which resolved after fluid challenge. Transthoracic echocardiogram ruled out pericardial effusion. Chest X-Ray was within normal limits (Figure 3 , panel A). He was discharged home asymptomatic the following day. Two days after, he presented again to the ED because of a syncope preceded by a similar vagal reaction. The ICD worked properly, and no arrhythmias were found. Chest X-Ray showed an area of lung dysventilation in the right lower lobe (Figure 3, panel B). CT scan of the chest confirmed bilateral pneumonia, with multiple ground-glass opacities with subpleural distribution (Figure 3, panel C). He was tested again for COVID-19 infection and resulted positive.</text>

      <text>The patient is a 75 year-old female who presented with fever, chills, and shortness of breath. The patient had a past medical history significant for multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, and parathyroid carcinoma status post parathyroidectomy. A chest x-ray (CXR) revealed possible atypical bilateral pneumonia consistent with COVID-19. The patient underwent coronavirus nasopharyngeal swab testing which was negative. However, due to the possible pneumonia and close to a 30% false negative coronavirus testing by nasopharyngeal swab, the patient was admitted for further observation. After admission to the COVID-19 hospital ward, evaluation of the patient revealed she was having word finding speech difficulties and right sided weakness. MR imaging revealed a large (5.7 × 3.9 × 2.9 cm), heterogenous contrast-enhancing left frontoparietal mass causing cerebral compression, edema, and midline shift of 7 mm (Fig. 1). The patient was started on high-dose steroids and given antiepileptics. The family was counseled on the need for a tissue diagnosis and possible surgical decompression of the tumor since the patient had evidence of right sided weakness from the tumor mass effect. However, after discussion with the family and the medical team, the decision was made to just perform a stereotactic biopsy of the mass for diagnostic purposes. Since there was no possibility for any postoperative rehabilitation due to closing of the rehabilitation unit, and the high likelihood the patient had a high-grade glioma in the setting of advanced age and comorbidities, a craniotomy was not offered to the patient. The stereotactic biopsy was performed and revealed a glioblastoma tumor. She also also had a CT scan of the chest which showed improvement of the findings on her initial CXR. The patient is starting radiation therapy and temozolomide at the end of month of April 2020 and will require high dose steroids due to edema and mass effect of the tumor.</text>

      <text>The patient is a 71 year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension and blindness secondary to glaucoma who presented to an outside hospital with right-sided facial palsy, altered mental status, and a fall eight days prior with no loss of consciousness or trauma. A head CT scan showed a large (3.9 × 3.4 × 5.5 cm) mass within the sella and suprasellar cistern with sellar expansion, moderate mass effect, and some obstructive hydrocephalus. The patient was then emergently transferred to our hospital for surgical evaluation and possible CSF diversion. She then underwent MRI, which suggested a pituitary adenoma with significant displacement of the optic apparatus, cavernous sinus, third ventricle and midbrain, along with hydrocephalus (Fig. 2). She also underwent standard pituitary tumor lab work-up, with results showing normal levels of prolactin (17.2), AM cortisol (18.9), and TSH (1.049) and low levels of IGF-1 (27), free T4 (0.68), and ACTH (2.5). Given that the prolactin level was within normal limits, we did not elect to manage the tumor medically, since it was not a prolactinoma. The hydrocephalus was from the obstruction of the 3rd ventricle due to mass effect from the large pituitary tumor. The patient was brought to the OR and underwent a right frontal ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VP) shunt and endoscopic septal fenestration with a CERTAS programmable valve. The standard of care, an endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal approach for maximal resection of tumor, was not offered at this time to the patient due to the COVID-19 crisis and the need to mitigate surgical exploration involving the nasopharynx as a nidus of infection. Instead, the patient was offered and underwent VP shunt placement to alleviate the emergent hydrocephalus. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged to home on postoperative day two.</text>

      <text>On February 16, 2020, a 36-year-old man presented to a local primary healthcare clinic with a mild cough and subjective fever for 1 day. He had no history of contact with COVID-19 patients. Physical examination revealed a body temperature of 38.4°C. A routine blood panel showed normal ranges of white blood cells count (8.9×109/L), neutrophils (6.1×109/L), and lymphocytes (1.8×109/L), as well as a high level of C reactive protein (25.2 mg/L). An oropharyngeal swab tested negative for influenza A and B but positive for SAR-CoV-2 by RT-PCR on February 17. The patient’s chest CT showed large, mixed, ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the lower lobe of right lung with partial consolidation, distribution along with bronchovascular bundles, and a little effusion of the right oblique fissure (Fig. 1, Panel A).</text>

      <text>The patient’s serum tested negative for SARS-CoV-2–specific IgM antibody on February 18. Consecutive samples were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing daily from February 18 to February 20 (ie, oropharyngeal swab and sputum). All of the repeated tests of viral nucleic acid were negative. A 5-day blood culture demonstrated no growth of bacteria or fungi. The patient’s symptoms gradually improved. A repeat chest CT scan on February 21 showed that the lesions in the right lower lobe had been partially absorbed (Fig. 1, panel B).</text>

      <text>On February 22, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing by RT-PCR and the result was also negative. On February 24, the patient’s serum tested negative for SARS-CoV-2–specific IgG antibody. All of his symptoms had disappeared by February 26. A follow-up chest CT on February 29 showed that the lesions in the right lower lobe had completely resolved (Fig. 1, panel C). After a consultation with the COVID-19 prevention and control committee in our hospital, the diagnosis was revised to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) considering no history of contact with COVID-19 patients and the negative results of consecutive repeat RT-PCR tests and the serum antibody test. The patient was released from quarantine and was discharged on the same day.</text>

      <text>The history of close contact with one COVID-19 case and the noticeable cough during the physical examination warranted further investigation. Her chest radiography (CXR) revealed an alveolar opacity in the left middle lung field (Figure 2A). Thus, a diagnosis of pneumonia probably due to COVID-19 was made. She was admitted to an airborne infection isolation room, and empirical treatments were started with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and oseltamivir. Initial blood tests apart from mild leukopenia showed no other abnormalities. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of sputum obtained on day 1 of admission was inconclusive for SARS-CoV-2, but sputum obtained on day 4 of admission was positive. Furthermore, she started to develop sore throat, mild cough, and diarrhea on day 3 of admission (Figure 1). Antibiotic and antiviral treatments were discontinued because RT-PCR for other respiratory viruses and bacteria from sputum was negative. Two rectal swabs were negative for SARS-CoV-2. She continued to receive supportive care and isolation until two consecutive sputum specimens were negative for SARS-CoV-2. All other family members who were previously screened negative remained asymptomatic, but one daughter tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. She was admitted for treatment and isolation in another hospital.</text>

      <text>A follow-up CXR obtained on day 6 of admission (Figure 2B) showed progression of the opacity in the left middle lung field and of her symptoms of cough, sore throat, and diarrhea. Further imaging studies were performed for educational purposes on day 12 after admission, when her symptoms were resolved, and the sputum RT-PCR was negative on two consecutive specimens. Chest radiography (Figure 2C) showed improvement of the alveolar opacity in the left middle lung field. Lung ultrasonography (LUS) (Figure 2D) was found to be positive for B lines and dynamic air bronchogram sign at the posterior part of the left middle lung field. A high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan on the same day (Figure 2E) showed a localized subpleural region of ground-glass opacity with superimposed inter- and intralobular septal thickening (crazy paving pattern) at the supero-posterior segment of the left lower lung lobe.</text>
